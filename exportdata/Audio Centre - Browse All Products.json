For a long time, they have understood the importance of the relationship between conductor materials and insulation, and its silver-plated speaker cables make extensive use of PTFE as an insulation material. \n\t\n\tThe type of insulation doesn’t just affect a cable’s ability to carry signals accurately, it also has an effect on the tonal characteristics that the cable brings to the system. This often takes the form of an unwanted increase in bass frequencies, which directly limits a system’s ability to produce music with coherence and involvement.\n\t\n\tTypically, cables that use oxygen-free copper as a conductor material will use either polyethylene or PVC as an insulating material. What sets The Chord Company’s Clearway speaker cable apart is its use of FEP: a derivative of PTFE with very similar performance characteristics. Compared to polyethylene, the FEP-insulated Clearway carries both detail and dynamic information markedly more accurately. The tonal properties of the cable are also considerably more neutral.\n\t\n\tThe FEP-insulated conductors are built from multi-strand oxygen-free copper and are arranged in a twisted-pair configuration to reduce interference. The two conductors are then protected with a layer of soft PVC (which was chosen over polyethylene because of its flexibility), in order to correctly space the shielding in relation to the conductors and to minimise any mechanically induced noise. \n\t\n\tHIGH FREQUENCY SHIELDING :\n\t\n\tHigh-performance shielding is specified and just like the award-winning Carnival SilverScreen, Chord Clearway speaker cable features two contra-wound high-density foil shields. Like many Chord speaker cables, the twin foils, combined with the twisted-pair configuration, make for a level of shielding that is effective to high frequencies. Finally, a clear protective PVC jacket is applied, which again serves to further reduce any mechanically induced noise.\n\t\n\tChord Clearway speaker cable borrows key ideas from our recent development projects. Clearway refines 30 years of Chord know-how into a ground-breaking, highly affordable new speaker cable.\n\t\n\tChord Clearway speaker cable features two contra-wound high-density foil shields.

And with a history stretching all the way to that ground-breaking Audio Consolette – which Saul B Marantz started manufacturing in 1952, and which soon became the first real Marantz product, the Model 1 preamplifier – , it’s no surprise that the company’s very latest Premium Series model, the PM-10, is an integrated amplifier built to set new standards with all of today’s music formats.\n\n\tIn fact, this massively powerful integrated amplifier is constructed more like a high-end separate preamplifier and a pair of monobloc power amps, but all in one beautifully finished case, designed both to maximise performance and create a strong visual statement.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaking an integrated amplifier with dual monobloc design fitting in a normal size cabinet is made possible by the use of a stereo switching amplifier. Its aim? To reveal the maximum musical involvement from everything from LPs to the latest high-resolution audio files and beyond, and with all the power and control required to drive the most demanding loudspeakers, allowing them to perform at their best.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOptimised design\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\tTo achieve such quality, while still delivering class-leading power, means optimising each section of the amplifier for its task, just as would be done in a design using a separate preamplifier and monobloc power amps.\n\n\tCommonly, amplifiers use a single transformer, with separate power supply regulation for the preamplifier and power amplifier sections; the PM-10 takes things much further.\n\n\t\n\n\tA dual-mono design, it has separate power supplies for the preamplifier and each of the power amplifier channels, with one transformer dedicated to the preamp to ensure the delicate signals passing through that section of the amplifier aren’t affected by the demands of the high power output stages. There’s also a dedicated supply for the microprocessor controlling volume adjustment, input selection and so on, ensuring no noise from the control section finds its way in to the audio path.\n\n\n\n\tPure analogue\n\n\n\tAnother important part of the noise-reduction here is the fact that the PM-10 is a purely analogue amplifier: many rival designs are today including digital-to-analogue conversion, or adopting digital amplification and volume control, but the Marantz keeps things as clean and simple as possible with its highly-developed all-analogue design.\n\n\tWhy? Well, though it may seem convenient to have a DAC in the amplifier, digital circuitry is, by its very nature, noisy (in the electrical sense) and can interfere with the delicate analogue signals passing through the amp. That’s why Marantz chooses to design its Premium Series range with any digital-to-analogue conversion in its Super Audio CD or network music players, keeping its amplifiers as pure and clean as possible.\n\n\tWhat’s more, to make the most of that purity of design, the PM-10 has also been designed with the option of working in ‘Purest Mode’: when engaged, this deactivates any superfluous circuits, giving the signal the cleanest possible path through the amplifier. There’s also a Power Amp Direct input, taking the signal straight from the input section to the power stage to let the unit work as a pure power amplifier.\n\n\n\n\tFully balanced, from input to final power section\n\n\n\tThe benefits of balanced audio layout have long been understood: unlike a conventional layout, one half of the signal path is in the ground plane of either an amplifier or a cable, balanced working uses two conductors or paths – one for positive, the other for negative – and an entirely separate ground to protect them.\n\n\tThe benefit in cables is that any external interference will affect both positive and negative conductors, but since the signals they are carrying are the mirror image of each other, they will mutually cancel out any effect – which is why such cables are widely used in pro audio and studio applications, where sources of hum are common, and the longer cable runs involved makes them particularly prone to picking up interference.\n\n\tThe same is true when balanced working is applied to audio circuitry: not only does this mirror-imaging of the layout, in which identical components are handling the positive and negative ‘legs’ of the signal, cancel out any potential interference, it also means any noise or errors introduced in the circuitry will also be cancelled out.\n\n\tAn additional benefit is that balanced working also uses stronger signals than unbalanced designs, simple because both halves of the circuit are active – rather than just having one half pushing and the other just providing the ground, here we have a ‘push pull’ operation. And a stronger signal means one less susceptible to any outside interference: the more signal there is, the less obvious any noise will be.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe PM-10 uses a fully balanced layout, from the input section all the way through to the final power amplifier section: it has two sets of balanced inputs, and also conventional unbalanced line-level inputs (plus a high-quality phono stage), the signal from these inputs being converted to balanced working before being passed through the amplifier.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tBy keeping the signal balanced all the way through the amplifier, and combining that with optimised power supply design, the Marantz engineers are able to achieve maximum noise rejection throughout the audio path, and the highest possible signal purity.\n\n\n\n\tBalanced, bridged power amplification\n\n\n\tFor the PM-10, Marantz wanted the purest possible sound, plus the power and dynamics to drive and control some of the world’s most demanding speakers. To achieve this, they continued the balanced working found in the preamp stage right the way through to the power amplifier stage to its speaker outputs, and also adopted bridged working to develop the power required while maintaining that balanced design. This True Balanced Concept realizes a ground-free signal management from the input to the output.\n\n\tWhat is the bridged amplifier about? In a conventional amplifier, one speaker is driven by the positive and negative part of one single output stage per channel, but a bridged amplifier does things differently, using two separate amplifier stages per channel to drive one speaker. To greatly simplify things: one amp pushes the speaker cones and domes, while the other pulls them back.\n\n\tThat much greater control over the way the speaker drive units behave, in that the amplifier can make them start moving, and stop, much more precisely is very important for definition and the ‘speed’ of the system, meaning it can play music with much better rhythmic and spatial controls, not to mention making voices and instruments sound more realistic.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the PM-10, the bridged amplifiers in the power output stage – a total of four amplifier channels – allow this control to be combined with huge power output: it delivers 2x200W into an 8ohm load, and can easily cope with demanding speakers or those whose impedance varies widely with frequency, thanks to a 2x400W output into 4ohms.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tThat ensures not just the power to drive even big, power-hungry speakers to high levels while keeping the sound clean and distortion-free, but also the ‘grip’ to make sure those speakers are doing just what the music demands. It’s all made possible by the use of the latest switching amplifier technology, allowing a compact integrated amplifier design while still fulfilling Marantz performance requirements.\n\n\n\n\tCarefully selected components\n\n\n\tMarantz has long built a reputation for choosing the best-possible components for its Premium Series products – and if it can’t find what it wants, it designs and builds the required part.\n\n\tThat thinking informed the design of the Hyper Dynamic Amplifier Module (or HDAM): unhappy with the audio quality available from ‘amplifier on a chip’ IC components, the company designed its own alternative, in the form of a miniature amplifier module built entirely of discrete components. As with all such design decisions, the engineers selected and optimised the HDAM through extensive listening in dedicated Marantz facilities in Europe and Japan, and since it was introduced this component has both been developed and also found its way into an ever-wider range of products.\n\n\t\n\n\tIn the PM-10, the latest-generation HDAM SA3 is used, as part of a current feedback topology designed for the widest possible frequency and dynamic ranges – just the thing for today’s ultra-high-resolution audio formats – and aided by ultra-fast custom made block capacitors for the fastest possible response to demands for high current.\n\n\tThe same current feedback design is applied to the phono stage in the PM-10, which is configurable for use with either moving coil or moving magnet cartridges for the best possible playback of those favourite LPs. This isn’t a case of Marantz responding to the current ‘vinyl revival’: over the years, while developing and refining its digital competences, the company has remained totally committed to the excellent sound possible from LPs and singles.

The SA-10 is designed to sets new standards, whether with music on disc or content streamed from a computer, and to become the New Reference in digital audio.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo achieve that, the SA-10 is a completely new design, drawing on all that experience in making great-sounding players but with virtually every part redesigned. That involved both innovation and some unique thinking, all in the cause of getting the best possible performance across a wide range of digital audio formats. The new model is an exceptional player of both CD and SACD discs, but can also play high-resolution music stored on computer-burned discs, as well as being a high-end digital to analogue converter for computer-stored music.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom the unique new disc transport designed for this player all the way through to a complete rethink of the way digital audio data is converted into analogue signals, the SA-10 is a ‘clean sheet’ design, the result of painstaking research and development and extensive listening in Marantz’s custom-built listening facilities. That’s symptomatic of the way Marantz has always done things: while it always aims for the most elegant engineering solution, the listening test is always the final arbiter. It’s all to do with that simple phrase running through the heart of everything the company does: ‘Because Music Matters’.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt starts with the disc\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhether playing SA-CD or CD, or data discs containing music, it’s vital that any player retrieves the information as accurately as possible: unlike a computer reading a disc for ripping, there’s no time for repeated re-scans when playing music – it happens in real time, so the disc transport needs to get things right first time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMany modern CD and SACD players use computer-style DVD or ‘universal’ disc drives, simply because it’s increasingly difficult for manufacturers to source dedicated ‘music drives’, purely designed for SACD/CD playback.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Marantz solution? If you can’t buy it off the shelf, design it and have it made: at the heart of the SA-10 is an all-new SACD-M3 transport mechanism, engineered solely for the best possible performance when playing SA-CDs, CDs and music stored on data discs.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNot only does this new mechanism promise the very best sound quality from conventional CD and SA-CD discs, its extended ability with the playback of music files stored on DVD-ROM discs makes it possible for users to create their own high-resolution audio compilation discs using a computer DVD burner. The SA-10 can play FLAC files from 32kHz to 192kHz at up to 24-bit resolution, and DSD64 and DSD128, well as ALAC (Apple Lossless), AIFF and MP3 files. That means making and playing hi-res disc compilations is now just as simple as it’s always been to make such discs in CD quality.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCDs, SA-CDs and beyond\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the SA-10 goes so much further than just disc playback: it’s also a fully-functional digital-to-analogue converter for music stored on a home computer, as well as having conventional digital inputs for existing source components.\n\t\t\t\t\tThose conventional inputs – optical and coaxial – can handle files at up to 192kHz/24bit, but in addition the player’s digital input section includes a USB-B asynchronous input for the direct connection of a computer, and this is compatible with PCM and DXD music files at up to 384kHz/32bit, as well as DSD64, DSD128 and DSD256.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat means the SA-10 is not only equipped to handle all the commonly-available high-resolution audio formats now sold by online retailers, but also the ultra-high-resolution files becoming available from a number of specialist labels and outlets. In other words, the new player is entirely futureproof.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat’s more, the digital input section is completely isolated, to avoid any electrical noise from connected components – a particular problem when computers are used as a source – from finding its way into the signal-path.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore than just a DAC\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCD players (and indeed amplifiers) with built-in DACs usable for computer audio are nothing new, and neither is DSD capability on such devices. Indeed, the Marantz range already has several CD/SA-CD models so equipped.\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the SA-10 takes things further – just as it features an all-new disc transport mechanism, so the digital to analogue conversion has also been subject to a radical rethink, taking full advantage of the 1-bit conversion technology found in past flagship Marantz players, and incorporating brand-new filtering and upconversion to take advantage of this simple, but elegant solution.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMarantz Musical Mastering:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMMM-Stream and MMM-Conversion\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDSD is at the heart of the way the SA-10 handles digital audio: PCM and DXD inputs are all upconverted to DSD at 11.2MHz using the proprietary MMM-Stream converter within the player, and then the high-frequency signal produced is processed by the unique MMM-Conversion stage, used in place of a conventional DAC, to produce the analogue output.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe MMM-Stream section of the process replaces the oversampling filters normally used in digital to analogue conversion, and allows the implementation of the Marantz Musical Mastering filtering. These filters – one providing a slow roll-off and very short impulse response, the other offering the option of a medium roll-off with short pre-ringing and longer post-ringing – are essentially the same as those found in the Marantz SA-11 disc player and NA-11 network music player, but here they’re implemented at a much higher oversampling rate, thanks to that upconversion to DSD11.2.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, two system clocks are used, to ensure the most accurate upconversion of the incoming signal, whether its from disc or the digital inputs: the 44.1kHz of CD, and its multiples – 88.2kHz, 176.4kHz and so on – are upsampled to 11.2896MHz, while 48kHz and its multiples are taken up to 12.288MHz. This is done for maximum precision, and to avoid any need for sample rate conversion of the kind were the system to have to convert, say, 192kHz audio to DSD11.2.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn addition, all of this conversion is now done in Digital Signal Processing with 32-bit floating-point precision, rather than the 24-bit integer method used in such systems in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCombining this with the reduction to a 1-bit signal straight after the oversampling filter and Sigma Delta Modulation allows a pure DSD-standard signal to be passed to the conversion section in the form of a very high-frequency stream of pulses, requiring only a very high-quality low-pass filter to remove all the superfluous high frequencies and pass the purest possible audio to the player’s output stage.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo why develop all this in-house? The Marantz engineering team says that, as ever, extensive listening sessions gave the reasons: ‘We found big sound quality differences when PCM signals got converted to DSD outside of a conventional DAC and then fed to the DSD input of the conventional DAC. The conclusion of our finding was that for best sound quality we have to do the conversion ourselves.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t“This experience led us to evaluate all kind of SDM structures and optimise this to achieve the best sound quality.”\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe same thinking informed the design of the DSD-to-analogue filter itself, which feeds into the familiar Marantz HDAM (Hyper Dynamic Amplifier Modules) in the output stage, here used in dual-differential configuration for optimal sound quality.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the same way, even the headphone output on the player is optimised: like the HDAMs, it’s built entirely from discrete components, rather than using simpler ‘amp on a chip’ technology, for the very best sound quality.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBuilt to perform\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLike the partnering PM-10 integrated amplifier, the SA-10 is constructed to the highest possible standards, with a double-layered copper-plated chassis for excellent rejection of mechanical and electrical interference, and casework constructed from thick non-magnetic aluminium panels and 5mm thick top lid.

this player, but in essence at the heart of the SA-10 is a digital-to-analogue solution that’s as elegant as it is innovative, and developed by the Marantz engineering team for one very simple

With the Reference cable range this heritage is delivered directly and without compromise. All QED cables are designed using the top down principle with Reference Subwoofer 40 representing the pinnacle of musical performance.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFLOATING INTERNAL FERRITE JACKET\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbsorbs high frequency noise signal components outside the audio band. When measured using high frequency measurement equipment, Audio 40 products convey a comparably cleaner and tighter signal pattern when its special Zn/Mn ferrite jacket is present. This has a beneficial effect on audio signal micro-timing and may account for the clear preference expressed for the ferrite jacket in listening tests. .\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJUST LISTEN\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSilver plated signal carriers, effective high quality shielding and low eddy current plugs all combine to create audible sonic improvements. We urge you to compare it not only to your favourite cable but also alternative brands and models at any price!\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANALOC RCA PLUGS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis all new locking design features small high purity gold plated copper conductors in place of the usual large volume brass body found in ordinary \"high quality\" plugs. This cuts down or eliminates the tendency for the changing magnetic field in the conductor to induce eddy currents which are thought to affect the micro-timing of the audio signal. Coupled with its hollow central pin, which is designed to combat the skin effect in the same way as our X-Tube speaker cables, the new QED Analoc plug maintains the fidelity of the audio signal from start to finish.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCOMPLEMENTARY CONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImproves timing and detail, retaining the rhythm of the original piece - vital when it comes to the \"bottom end.\" Unlike conventional analogue interconnects, Reference Audio 40 uses two silver plated 99.999% Oxygen Free Copper conductors of different diameters to carry the same audio signal. This has the effect of providing an alternative signal path for more subtle audio components which might otherwise become time smeared in a single audio pathway. Reference Sub Woofer 40 is further optimised by having a 25% smaller diameter than Reference Audio 40 making it more convenient for those long runs around the room.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSPECIFICATIONS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQED Complementary Conductor TechnologyTM with 99.99% Silver Plated Oxygen Free Copper\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tZn/Mn ferrite jacket to absorb high frequency noise signals\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLow losss foamed polyethylene (PE) dielectric\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t99.999% Oxygen Free Copper braid for 100% electromagnetic screening coverage in a coaxial geometry\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTwin leaf 24c Gold plated QED AnalocTM RCA plugs featuring high purity copper contacts, hollow centre pin and low eddy current design\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConductor Section 0.30 mm2\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParallel Capacitance 124 pF/m\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLoop Resistance 0.076 Ω/m\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLoop Inductance 0.33 uH\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDissipation Factor @ 10 kHz 0.0210\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOutside Diameter 6 mm\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1650/1/qedd40.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1650/2/qeddd40.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1650/3/201805040825298400.jpg","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1637","curve":" QED Supremus (2 x 2 m) Speaker Cable","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1637/1/supremus_1.jpg","curve2":"SUPREMUS\nQED Supremus loudspeaker cable is the ultimate expression of sound born of pure science.\nDeveloped without compromise, it has been 21 years in the making.\n\nSupremus Speaker Cable\nThe largest cross sectional area of pure copper ever incorporated into a QED loudspeaker cable, enables Supremus to deliver the ultra-low resistance required to ensure perfect fidelity of the musical signal.","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 14.900.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1637","Title":" QED Supremus (2 x 2 m) Speaker Cable","Text":"\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\tSUPREMUS\n\tQED Supremus loudspeaker cable is the ultimate expression of sound born of pure science.\n\tDeveloped without compromise, it has been 21 years in the making.\n\t\n\tSupremus Speaker Cable\n\tThe largest cross sectional area of pure copper ever incorporated into a QED loudspeaker cable, enables Supremus to deliver the ultra-low resistance required to ensure perfect fidelity of the musical signal.\n\t\n\tAirCoreTM Technology, unique to QED cables, means unrivalled high frequency detail, rhythm and timing.\n\t\n\tSupremus Plugs Supremus boasts sixteen silver plated, 99.999% oxygen free copper, solid core conductors.

It is available as a 2 sq mm cable or a 3 sq mm cable or in the form of a bi-wire Equator cable using 2.sq mm for the bass and two conductors of 1.2 sq mm for the treble. Unlike it's less expensive siblings, the Equator series use a polypropylene dielectric thats far more efficient than PVC or polyethylene, and which gives greater signal velocity or speed thereby maintaining improved phase stability. The conductors are contained in a cotton yarn in order to reduce microphony and the outer sheath is in a tasteful pearl white finish.\n\n\tThe Equator cables give an assured fatigue free performance with extended and sweet treble and a satisfying bass. Altogether these cables offer an effortless sound that provides a holographic sound stage with stereo width, height and depth that involve the listener.

We haven't come close to finding a pair of stereo interconnects that come close to offering the same kind of value. It's well-balanced, powerful sound is unbeatable at this price point.\n\n\t \n\n\tThe New Atlas Equator Integra recommended by HiFi Choice.\n\n\tIn the October 2012 edition, HiFi Choice commented:\n\n\tAnd in the great scheme of interconnect(ed) things, the Equator III is very fine indeed – you’ll not find much at the price >that comes close in terms of musicality.\n\n\t \n\n\tThe New Atlas Equator Integra ticked all the boxes at What HiFi.\n\n\tIn the January 2012 edition, What HiFi said:\n\n\tWorking with the cable, our kit's performance gained additional dynamics and detailing within a spacious, well-timed and tonally neutral sound. In short, there's nothing to dislike here, if you want a fine second-upgrade interconnect, look no further than this Atlas.\n\n\t \n\n\tProduct Information\n\n\tAtlas Scotland understands the meaning of uncompromising performance. Is the ubiquitous Atlas Equator asymmetrical the best interconnect on the market? It sure is at it's price!\n\n\tThe Atlas Equator Mk11 has been awarded the What Hi Fi best stereo interconnect of 2007 and 2008. In Mk1 form it was awarded the same accolade in 2002 and 2003.\n\n\tFollowing from our research and development programme, the Equator is fitted with our entirely new Integra plug. We were stunned when we first heard the improvement in sound quality we'd achieved with the new Atlas non magnetic plug.\n\n\tThe plug benefits from a solder free, cold weld interface between the 99.9999% pure copper co-axial stranded conductors and the plug for both the going and return signals. being free of solder, another barrier to the free-flow of the signal has been removed.\n\n\tThe Integra plug employs two conjugate brackets. These brackets grip the cable without compressing it. Compressing a coaxial causes the cable to alter its impedance from 75 Ohms thereby causing deletions. In a digital interface the impedance can drop to some 40 Ohms which causes reflections and jitter. The Integra plug lets more information through.\n\n\tThe integra plug with conjugate brackets entirely rejects radio frequency interference all the way from the plug to conductor interface so there's less deletions or interference.\n\n\tThe integra plug contains four asymmetrical sleeves that are sprung and which spread on insertion thereby cleaning the plug to socket interface every time the plug is inserted. It's easy to keep a clean signal path with the Atlas Integra plug, just remove it and re-insert it!\n\n\tThe Integra plug uses a non magnetic ABS cover which may avoid a saturation in the return leg at an RCA plug's metal sheath if it's in the signal path. The integra sheath facilitates a direct barrier free return signal path with less interference.\n\n\tThe Equator coaxial cable employs two woven screens for 100% coverage and the efficient rejection of radio frequency interference.\n\n\tFinally the Equator Integra is provided with a unique seriel number and a five year guarantee. Buyers may be confident they've purchased a genuine Atlas cable, researched, developed and produced in Scotland and made from the finest materials available.\n\n\tA consistent winner, the improved Equator Integra is obviously the entry level audio interconnect for discerning music lovers. Like all Atlas interconnects, it provides a huge sound-stage together with a smooth delivery. It avoids the over bright and irritating sound so often a feature of similarly priced interconnects. Rather in common with all Atlas interconnects, irrespective of price, it offers the listener a sophisticated and relaxing sound with no artificial highs or lows.\n\n\tYou'll get more from an Atlas Equator Integra. We hope like we were, when you hear the improvement in quality you too will be stunned. Visit an Atlas stockist today, and try the Equator Integra and enjoy the sophisticated and revealing broad band sound. Other cables can skew sound quality into a high frequency bias in order to initially impress the listener. That sound can cause fatigue, an Atlas sound will never irritate or cause fatigue. It will give the listener many hours of relaxed pleasure, isn't that what HiFi is for?\n\n\tPut your trust in the Atlas Equator Integra.\n\n\tSee an exploded version of the Atlas integra plug here.\n\n\t \n\n\tProduct Specifications:\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFeatures\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConstruction :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAsymmetrical\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConductor Material :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOFC\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tScreen Type/Material :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOFC\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tScreen Coverage %:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t94.8%\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDielectric :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tfoamed PE\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConnector :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRCA Plug\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAvailable Lengths\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLengths :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t0.5m 1.0m 1.5m 2.0m\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso Available in Custom Lengths.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTechnical Data\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCapacitance (pF/m) :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t54.85\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tResistance (Ohms/m @20°C): :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t0.0094 Ω/M at 23oC\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInductance (µH/m @1 kHz) :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t0.416\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tVelocity of propagation :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUndertaking research\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/559/1/EquatorAsymmetricalIntegraRCA.jpg","Image_URL_2":"","Image_URL_3":"","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=658","curve":"ATLAS Hyper 2.0 (without banana plug)","curve_URL1":"","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/658/1/Hyper2.0SpeakerCable.jpg","curve2":"The Atlas Hyper cables offer unbeatable value.

Choose the 1.5 where bass isn't a priority or for rear speakers in a 5.1 system for example. Choose the Hyper 2.0 or 3.0 for increased bass and the Bi-Wire for improved high frequency information in a bi-wire speaker system.\n\n\tThe Atlas Hyper cables share many similarities with the more advanced Ascent models. The Hyper cables are smooth and refined allowing for continuous listening over a prolonged period without causing listener fatigue.\n\n\tWe sincerely recommend these are used in conjunction with the range of Hyper interconnects. The Asymmetrical will offer excellent clarity with definition; great  for modern music. The Hyper Symmetrical offers a more sophisticated and relaxing analogue-like presentation with extra width, depth  and height. The fully balanced Atlas Hyper Symmetrical with Atlas XLR plugs, should be used in a balanced system for optimum noise free results. All the Hyper speaker cables offer superb fidelity, however for the best results, the interconnects and the speaker cables were designed to match. If an interconnect is used that cannot feed throught to the speaker via the speaker cables, a complete signal, then it matters not how good the speakers or the speaker cables may be, they cannot recover information lost by an interconnect. \n\n\tNote: the biggest complaint we hear from people calling our help line, is that their system sounds bright and they find it irritating. The cables they've been sold are usually silver plated cables. We don't try to skew the sound into a high frequency bias in order to impress by using silver plated conductors; good high frequency information is provided by improved VOP (velocity of propagation) and quality dielectrics. These can't be done on the cheap and we won't compromise our principals by selling something we don't feel is appropriate or with which we don't feel comfortable.\n\n\tAWG equivalence table.\n\n\tComplementary products:\n\n\tComplementary products are the excellent Hyper Symmetrical interconnect fully balanced with Atlas solder free XLR plugs, the Symmetrical pseudo balanced Hyper interconnect with Atlas conjugate bracket RCA plugs, the Hyper digital interconnect, the Hyper 1.5 and 3.0 speaker cable and Hyper Bi Wire speaker cable all with Atlas solder free Z Plugs or OFC spades\n\n\tRecommended accessories:\n\n\tRecommended accessories for even better results, are the Atlas Eos power cables and the Atlas Eos balanced power supply.\n\n\tRemoval of the brass links between HF and LF terminals typically provided on speakers, and their replacement with better quality Atlas links will also contribute to much improved sound and listening pleasure.\n\n\tDNA of Atlas Audio Cables\n\n\tThe Atlas range of products has gathered ‘five star’ awards and superb reviews since its introduction.\n\n\tFor those who’d like to know more about the technology behind these cables, we have a technical document DNA of Atlas audio products\n\n\t \n\n\tHiFi News, 'Highly Commended'\n\n\tFrom the Group Test:\n\n\t\n\t\tthe cable’s balanced and even character brought out the instruments’ timbre.\n\t\n\t\tPercussion was powerful with a deep, taut bass while the brass had lifelike ‘rasp’ when the occasion demanded.\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\n\t\n\t\tProduct Specifications:\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFeatures\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConstruction :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t65 Concentric Strands x 2\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConductor Material :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOFC\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDielectric :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTeflon\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConnector :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tZ-Plug or OFC Spade\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOuter Diameter (mm) :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t7.0mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAvailable Lengths\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLengths :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.0m 3.0m 5.0m\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\talso available in custom lengths.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t50m Reel\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTechnical Data\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCapacitance (pF/m) :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t73.42 PF/M at 1KHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tResistance (Ohms/m @20°C): :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t0.0088 Ω/M at 20oC\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInductance (µH/m @1 kHz) :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t0.5178 uH/M at 1KHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tVelocity of propagation :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t0.72 VOP\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/658/1/Hyper2.0SpeakerCable.jpg","Image_URL_2":"","Image_URL_3":"","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1568","curve":"Atoll AM 100 SE","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=promo","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1568/1/am100.jpg","curve2":"The AM100 SE stereo block suits most hi-fi or audio-video applications.

This means the 8300CD can be connected directly to a stereo power amp, or a pair of monoblocks like the new Audiolab 8300MB, as well as to a traditional integrated amp like the equally new Audiolab 8300A.\n\t\n\t8300 Series also allows control of music playing from a PC/Mac/media device via USB. When connected to a computer, the 8300CD not only identifies itself as an asynchronous DAC, but also as a HID-compatible device (Human Interface Device). This allows driverless control of the PC/Mac/media player (Play, Pause, Stop, Track Select etc).\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\tDesign\n\t\n\t\tNew Updated Aesthetic\n\t\n\t\tThe newly updated external structure of the 8300 series follows the new design aesthetic of Audiolab products going forward, incorporating softened lines and textures yet still maintaining Audiolab’s instantly recognisable and contemporary style.\n\t\t\n\t\tThe 8300 series’ blasted aluminium finish, CNC routed aluminium dials and display certainly look cutting-edge, yet with every Audiolab product, form follows function. The new display and controls enable a fast and intuitive access through the vast routing options and filter settings in both the A and CD.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDesign\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSlot-Loading CD Mechanism\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOur extensive research and development found that previous tray-style mechanisms sometimes produced a rare weak spot. The 8300CD sports a new mechanism that includes slot loading – much quicker and neater than the old tray.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe new mechanism also reduces the occurrence of disc rejection, able to play CDs that other CD players may reject for being imperfect from dirt or damage. Its digital buffer circuit is a perfect mate to the asynchronous input of the DAC, improving even this area of performance. A final benefit is increased disc stability and reduced susceptibility to resonance, which additionally contributes to the overall improved sound quality.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDesign\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConnections\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConnectivity options have been further expanded on the 8300CD with the addition of an AES/EBU digital input and XLR digital output. These join a full complement of inputs/outputs retained from the 8200CD: 2x coaxial digital inputs; 2x optical digital inputs; 1x asynchronous USB input; 1x coaxial digital output; 1x optical digital output; single-ended RCA and balanced XLR analogue outputs.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn the 8300A Engineers have developed a new phono stage catering for the resurgence in vinyl records with MM and MC configurations accessible via the front panel controls.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t12V remote trigger loop feature on all units so as one device is switched on, paired units are switched into or out of standby mode - working as one system for quick operation.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTechnology\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHigher Resolution\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe new 8300CD can accept and process data up to 32-bit/384kHz; this is a far higher specification than that required even by current hi-res music formats, ensuring the 8300CD is fully equipped for future advances in ultra-high-definition digital sound.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe USB input now also accepts DSD data, as well as PCM. This is a significant addition, as DSD has an important role to play in the developing high-res digital download scene. Accordingly, the filter section now includes four extra filters for DSD playback, allowing the user to optimise the noise floor to suit the performance of the source file and the bandwidth of associated equipment such as amplifiers and loudspeakers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe uprated digital processing associated with the increased resolution at the USB input delivers additional sonic benefits, for both CD replay and other connected digital sources, whatever the resolution of the file. In advancing the capability of the USB input to include files of up to 32-bit/384kHz, the processing of data preceding and within the Sabre DAC has increased the subjective resolution of musical detail and dynamics, resulting in a more energetic and transparent performance that sets a new standard for CD players at this price level.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnology\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital Filter Optimisation\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs digital audio reproduction technology has progressed, the importance of the characteristics of reconstruction digital filters has become more appreciated. The Audiolab 8300CD features user-selectable digital filters for optimal listening. These filter settings allow the user to tune the 8300CD’s performance to suit his or her preference, depending on system configuration and musical taste. These filters are available for CD and PCM audio via digital inputs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Optimal Spectrum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Optimal Transient\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Optimal Transient XD\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Optimal Transient DD\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Sharp Roll Off\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Slow Roll Off\n\t\t\t\t\t\t• Minimum Phase\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe 8300CD also adds four DSD filters that progressively attenuate the out of audio bandwidth noise floor.

The M-PWR simply connects to the pre-amp RCA outputs on the Q-DAC (and has provision to connect via balanced XLR outputs for the M-DAC).\n\t\n\tThe M-PWR is a hotly anticipated product. Following on from the huge success of the Audiolab M-DAC, there is finally a matching component for all Audiolab M-DAC customers who want to add speakers to their system and may have only previously used the M-DAC for headphones listening. M-PWR gives you the option of both and we're on hand to make matching speakers recommendations! M-PWR is rated at 40W making it more than powerful enough for most bookshelf speakers. Equally, for those of you who prefer the features of the stripped down Q-DAC, the M-PWR is an equally impressive match.\n\t\n\tFor those of you that use your M-DAC or Q-DAC as part of a computer set-up, the M-PWR is attractive thanks to the fact it takes up the same small amount of space as the DAC and is conveniently matched without needing a full hi-fi cabinet to accommodate it. Similarly though, for those of you using the M-DAC within a hi-fi system, the M-DAC and M-PWR should fit on a single shelf of many hi-fi racks, thus offering a complete DAC/pre/power solution from conveniently small cases.\n\t \n\n\tSPECIFICATIONS\n\n\t\n\t\tPower output: 2 x 40W (8 ohm), 2 x 60W (4 ohm)\n\t\n\t\tTotal Harmonic Distortion: <0.008% (10W 1kHz), <0.05% (10W, 20Hz - 20KHz)\n\t\n\t\tFrequency Response: -0.5dB (20Hz - 20kHz, ref. 1KHz)\n\t\n\t\tInput Sensitivity: 600mV (RCA Line In)\n\t\n\t\tInput Impedance: 10Kohms (Balanced), 20Kohms (Unbalanced)\n\t\n\t\tSignal to Noise Ratio: 106dB (A Weighted, ref. 40W)\n\t\n\t\tDimensions: 246.5mm x 114mm x 252mm (W x H x D)\n\t\n\t\tWeight: 5.8Kg (Gross, packed)\n\t\n\t\tWeight: 4.7kg (Net, unpacked)\n\n","Price":"Rp 9.500.000,-","Discounted_Price":"Rp 5.500.000,-","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1721/1/audiolab_m-pwr_side_sil.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1721/2/audiolab-m-pwr-power-amplifier-1804-p.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1721/3/m-pwr_20150330120820_154.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1721/4/61Y4nc8zORL._SL1200_.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2404","curve":"Audioquest Cinnamon Digital Coaxial Cable RCA to RCA 1.5m","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2404/1/CinnamonDigitalCoaxialAC.jpg","curve2":"AudioQuest Digital Coax cables are designed to minimize distortion across an extremely wide bandwidth.

Like all AudioQuest HDMI cables, Cinnamon uses Solid High-Density Polyethylene Insulation, and precise geometry. Specific attention has been paid to maximizing the performance of HDMI, and indeed, AudioQuest’s HDMI cables push sonic performance to new levels.\n\n\tSOLID 1.25% SILVER CONDUCTORS: Solid conductors eliminate strand-interaction distortion and reduce jitter. Solid silver-plated conductors are excellent for very high-frequency applications, like HDMI audio and video. These signals, being such a high frequency, travel almost exclusively on the surface of the conductor. As the surface is made of high-purity silver, the performance is very close to that of a solid silver cable, but priced much closer to solid copper cable. This is an incredibly cost effective way of manufacturing very high-quality HDMI cables.\n\n\tFOAMED-POLYETHYLENE INSULATION: Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy (loss). Some of this energy is stored and then released as distortion. Cinnamon HDMI uses air-filled Foamed-Polyethylene Insulation because air absorbs next to no energy and Polyethylene is low-loss and has a benign distortion profile. Thanks to all the air in Foamed-PE, it causes much less of the out-of-focus effect common to other materials.\n\n\tHIGH SPEED DATA CAPACITY: HDMI standards and capabilities have improved significantly since DVI first evolved into HDMI. All generations are backward compatible. However, not all previous HDMI cables can transmit the full 18Gbps of data required to optimize today’s HDMI 2.0 equipment. While there is currently no 4K/60 4:4:4 software requiring the full 18Gbps capability of HDMI 2.0, some sources (UHD Blu-ray players) can be set to upsample, requiring 18Gbps capability. (Upsampling often should be done in the TV rather than in a previous component — but that’s your decision.) It is important to understand that all AudioQuest HDMI cables up to 8 meters are guaranteed to exceed the requirements for all possible HDMI 2.0/HDCP 2.2 data streams, including 4K UltraHD, HDR, and Blu-ray Ultra HD. In addition, AudioQuest Cinnamon makes use of Active Frequency-Equilization to enable full 18Gbps/4K UltraHD performance from 10 to 15 meters.\n\n\t\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1443/1/2521077_8d1b59a4-0531-4b22-a707-0b47d58f5eb5_350_350.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1443/2/2521077_8ab7a034-7773-4960-9a18-14dc6fbd0eba_350_350.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1443/3/2521077_66bb3437-c9ea-45e7-904b-a78dc16f5e6f_300_300.jpg","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2392","curve":"Audioquest Dragonfly Black USB DAC Support MQA","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2392/1/DragonflyBlackAC.jpg","curve2":"DragonFly Black, the most affordable model of the award-winning DragonFly family, has been praised by Darko.Audio as “the quintessential everyman hi-fi product,” while its more sophisticated sibling, DragonFly Red, combines significantly improved performance with still exceptional value.

This creates distortion and low-level signal losses via the “masking effect.” Further, power amplifiers can require immense reserves of transient current for their power supplies to react to and then stabilize during dynamic audio passages. Most AC power cords and power conditioner-regenerators, though helpful to a point, are simply not up to the task.\n\n\t \n\n\tPower amplifiers present a real challenge for any AC power source, as the transient current requirements (though short in duration) can be many times that of the average (RMS) current consumption. Power amplifiers are also unique from all other components in that the current draw is dynamic, not constant, and it changes with volume and audio signal content. Though many AC power cords may feature low DC resistance to allow for some of this requirement, the characteristic impedance of the AC cable is equally responsible for assuring uncompromised performance. Many premium AC cords constrict or compress the audio transient as their characteristic impedance restricts the transient current.\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2289/1/ThunderRevisi.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2289/2/52d89b5b-9571-4ee9-ae9e-8030bf1a9171.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2289/3/947be184-04a3-4858-90b4-34db0e6d8ead.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2289/4/Thunder.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2272","curve":"Audiovector  R3 Signature Floorstanding Speaker Made in Denmark","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=fivestar","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2272/1/R3Signature.jpg","curve2":"The R 3 Series is a compact speaker line based on a mixture of evolution and new inventions.

This combination creates a hightended, 3D-audio cinematic exxperience because the BMR radiates not hyst in a narrow cone-shaped format, but across the full 180 degress. This creates a very open sound stage where each soundd effects is perceived to have its own position - wherever you sit. In addtion, because the BMR tweeter responds to frequencies as low as 300Hz (rather than 3000 Hz for traditional tweeters) movie dialogue is delivered from a single source, so there is no single sweet spot for the audience Conventional high0end centre speakers usually deliver dialogue from two midrange speakers either side of a tweeter, but as the listener moves either left or right, one speaker will consequently be close to him and the other will by further away. This differential causes wherever you sit, with intimate, delicate details placed exactly where they were intende just in front of you, far away, or right beside you..whispering into you ear.\n\t\n\t\n\tMain Features\n\t- BMR\n\t  Balanced Mode Radiators combine the latest flat panel loudspeaker technology with traditional pistonic-action techniques, The result is 180-degree sound dispersion and a soundstage that places each and every instrumen and vocalist in their own fixed position. Typical high frequency drivers tend to have significanly reduced output level at the top of their range as you ears move off axis from the driver. In other words, if the center of the driver is pointed directly at you ear, it will sound correct but as you move to the side so that you ear is at an Increasing angel to the driver, the high frequencies will ddiminish more quickly compared to the lower frequencies, The wide high-frequency dispersion characteritic of the BMT provides a more consistent sound experience for all of the listeners in the room.\n\t- Lo-Q cabinet\n\t  All m-series models are framed by a doublelayer side panel. Each of the two layers is 10 mm thick, an sandwiched between them is the Boston Acoustics specially-developed SDF damping elastomer. This absorbs the internally generated cibration and ensures that the speaker cones remain autonomous. So absolutely nothing is added to the music, and absolutely nothing is taken away\n\t- Crossover\n\t  If the drivers are the heart, and the cabinet the body, the crossover is the soul of the speaker. The crossover is an electronic circuit that directs the appropriate sound range to each transducer and maintains the phase/timing accuracy between all of the transducers. All the parts in the crossover - resistors, capacitors, inductors – have an effect on the sound, and choosing the right parts will deliver the sound that the system is truly capable of. Special elements such as low loss film capacitors and low distortion laminated silicon steel core inductors have been used at all critical areas. \n\t- Laser-Based vibration management \n\t Laser-based vibration measuring has helped degine the exact, optimised position for each cabinet's internal bracing and mounting locks. This ensures that negative resonance are not just shifted to other frequencies but are totally minimised.\n\t\n\tSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency Range (±3dB)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t68Hz - 22kHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHigh-Frequency Driver\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t6.4cm BMR flat panel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMid-Frequency Driver\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t6.4cm BMR flat panel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCrossover Frequency\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t700 Hz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNominal (Min) Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t6 ohms\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSensitivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t87dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRecommended Amplifier Power\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t50-200 Watts\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDimension (W x W x D) in cm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t16 x 55 x 18\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWeight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t10kg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAvailable Colors\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHigh Gloss Black\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLow-Frequency Driver(s)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t2 x 11.4cm\n\t\t\t\tPolypropylene cones\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2104/1/MCenter.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2104/2/g065MCTR-B-1.jpg","Image_URL_3":"","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2105","curve":"Boston Acoustics M Sub Black  Subwoofer (SALE 2020)","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=promo","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2105/1/MSub.jpg","curve2":"The 10-inch high exxcursion subwoofer recreates low bass audio at high levels, while the dual 8-inch passive radiators ensure deep, clear, and rich bass response.

Another benefit of the separate midrange chamber is that it doubles as a reinforcing brace near the top of the cabinet to add rigidity and reduce cabinet vibrations even further.\n\t- Standing wave prevention\n\t  A common problem with conventional floorstanding speakers is the build-up of standing waves and their consequent inteference. No such risk with the M-Series.

Combine this with the balance control for handling potential cartridge imbalacen in your recaord player (that can cause a defference between the left and right channles) and the result is a detailed experience with accurate soundstage\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\tSPEC ALVA SOLO:\n\tMax Power Consumption: 10W\n\tGain @1khz: 39dB\n\tNominal Output: 300mV\n\tSensitivity for nominal output: 3-35mV\n\tEquivalent input noise (A-Weighted): ~0.09uV\n\tRIAA Curve Accuracy: +/- 0.65dB 30Hz- 20kHz\n\tSignal to noise ratio grounded inputs ref 1V output (20Hz -20khz BW)\n\tTHD+N 1KHZ: <0.0025%\n\tINPUT IMPEDANCE: 47k Ohm\n\tInput Capacitance: 100pF\n\tOverload Margin: >30dB\n\tCrosstalk @10khz: >85dB\n\tDimension (HxWxD): 28 x 176 x 132\n\tWeight: 2\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2052/1/ALVASOLO.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2052/2/Cambridge_Audio_Solo_Gallery_01.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2052/3/Cambridge_Audio_Solo_Tech_Specs_Back.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2052/4/Cambridge_Audio_Solo_Gallery_03.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2005","curve":"Cambridge Audio AXA25 Integrated Amplifier | Amplifier","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2005/1/revisiAXA25.jpg","curve2":"Offering 25 watts of power per channel in a great value package, the AXA25 features a 3.5mm aux input on the front for smartphones and four analogue inputs on the back panel for connecting all your sources.","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 3.700.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2005","Title":"Cambridge Audio AXA25 Integrated Amplifier | Amplifier","Text":"\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\tPOWER OUTPUT\n\t\n\t\t25 Watts (into 8 Ohms)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTHD (UNWEIGHTED)\n\t\n\t\t<0.015% @ 1kHz, 80% of rated power <0.15% 20Hz – 20kHz, 80% of rated power <0.1% 20Hz – 20kHz @ 10W\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFREQUENCY RESPONSE (-3DB)\n\t\n\t\t(-3dB) 10Hz - 30kHz\n\n\n\t\n\t\tS/N RATIO (REF 1W)\n\t\n\t\t>82dB (unweighted)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tINPUT IMPEDANCES\n\t\n\t\t32k ohms\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPOWER AMP DAMPING FACTOR\n\t\n\t\t> 100\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMAX.

At its heart lies our own proprietary Class XD technology, which has been refined and enhanced since its inception in the 840 series, allowing even greater musical detail to be delivered to your speakers.\n\n\tLike all Cambridge Audio products, the 851A adheres to our three core values: stunning performance, ease of use and incredible value.\n\n\tCapable of delivering an enormous 120 watts of high-quality power, it benefits from two audiophile-grade toroidal transformers: one for the sensitive preamp section and one for the power stages allowing the 851A to deliver its immense output without stress. This incredible speaker-taming amount of power can be precision-controlled with another innovation found in the 851A - the new fully balanced silicon gate volume control, which gives very fine adjustment across the volume range and highly accurate channel-balancing.\n\n\tBecause everyone's needs are different, the 851A offers two main types of connectivity: the more commonly found RCA/Phono inputs, plus two pairs of fully balanced XLR connections. Our matching 851C upsampling CD player also features both types of connection, allowing you to connect your system in the very highest quality possible.\n\n\tSpeaking of flexibility, you can even control your iPhone, iPad or iPod using the 851 Series remote control when they're docked in our matching iD100 digital dock.\n\n\tUnlike many high end amplifiers which excel in one area over another, we believe the 851A offers the perfect combination of high performance, flexibility and ease of use. It's designed to take your listening experience to an entirely different level and we invite you to audition our best amplifier to date at your nearest Cambridge Audio specialist.\n\n\t \n\n\tFeatures\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClass XD amplification designed to eliminate crossover distortion at low signal levels\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNew balanced volume topology controllable in 1dB steps, giving very fine control, and superbly accurate channel balance\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAudiophile grade oversize toroidal transformer and substantial extruded heatsink allowing 2 x 120 Watts RMS into 8 Ohms or 2 x 200W into 4 ohms.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeparate transformer taps for left and right channels, twin rectifiers and separate PSUs for dual mono operation of the left and right power amplifiers\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA separate toroidal transformer supplies the preamp making the 851A effectively a Pre and Power amp combination in one box\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCAP5 protection technology for trouble free operation\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAcoustically damped full metal chassis with thick brushed aluminium front panel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCustomisable front panel display\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBalanced and unbalanced analogue audio inputs for superior connectivity\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRS232 controllable\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEco-friendly <0.5W Standby power consumption\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAvailable in black and silver finishes\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\n\t\n\t\tClass XD\n\t\n\t\tClass XD, a proprietary Cambridge Audio technology, is a unique amplifier circuit design created to offer the optimum sound quality currently available from existing amplifier configurations, whilst retaining the high power levels required for truly dynamic performance. It was conceived by our London-based engineering team to combine the best of both worlds from Class A and Class A/B amplifier operation.\n\t\t\n\t\tClass XD (crossover displacement), gives the benefits of pure Class A operation at low levels and eliminates the distortion associated with conventional Class B operation as the fragile audio signal passes though the zero crossing point from transistor to transistor. Distinct from Class AB, XD technology feeds a controlled current into the output stage in such a way that the usual Class B crossover points no longer occur either side of zero volume - the worst possible position in terms of distortion – but displaced to a point where the transfer functions of the transistors are better matched, at a significant output level where it is less audible. The system operates outside of the feedback loop so is not directly involved in the signal amplification itself.\n\t\t The result is a smooth and linear transition between the two key operating modes, Class A and B.\n\t\t\n\t\tThe benefits of this approach give the sonic refinements of Class A operation and the uncompromising efficiency and power of Class B operation. In fact, the new 851A delivers a gigantic 120 watts per channel - enough for the most demanding speaker set-up.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\n\t\n\t\tReviews\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\"Well, here is a treat!

How?\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\tOur unique ATF2 (Adaptive Time Filtering) upsampling technology, developed in conjunction with Anagram Technologies, Switzerland.\n\t\n\t\tAll incoming audio data, such as CD at 16-bit 44.1kHz CD, is upsampled to 24-bit 192kHz using a high-end 32-bit Analog Devices DSP (Digital Signal Processor). \"Polymomial Curve Fitting Interpolation\" provides a much more accurate upsampled audio soundwave than traditional upsampling processes. And a unique timing system buffers audio data to almost eradicate digital jitter. Vital – as jitter, common in digital audio devices, loses vital detail, often leaving digital audio sounding flat and lifeless.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\tOur latest ATF2 DSP also features a selectable digital filter with three settings to suit listener preferences and their particular system set-up: \n\t\t\n\t\t• The Steep roll-off filter exhibits strong attenuation of aliasing images outside the pass band (i.e. above 22.05kHz) at the expense of a little pre and post-ringing in the time domain. \n\t\t\n\t\t• The Linear phase filter uniquely features ‘constant group delay’ which delays all audio signals at all frequencies by the same amount meaning all audio is fully time-coherent at the output.\n\t\t\n\t\t• Minimum phase meanwhile does not feature constant group delay but rather the co-efficients have been optimised without feed-forward so that the impulse response exhibits no pre-ringing in the time domain.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\n\tReviews\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\"So while the 851C DAC/player brings a quiet composure to the party, the 851A is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, a muscular amp that grips the speakers and serves up tight, powerful and extended bass. In the 851C and 851A you’re getting cutting-edge technology for substantially less than high-end prices.

As the 851D is also a pre-amp so can be directly connected to a power amp such as our 851W or active speakers for further sonic benefits.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCOMPLETE DIGITAL PRE-AMPLIFIER\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMarking the Cambridge Audio 851D out from its DAC rivals is the unmatched flexibility. Take a deep breath and take in the following. There are a total of six digital inputs including a professional standard AES/EBU, rare BNC, twin dedicated opticals plus two more inputs offering the option of coaxial or optical. There is also an asynchronous USB link that supports high resolution audio files up to 192kHz, making the 851D ideal for high resolution music playback from your computer. In terms of connecting the DAC to your amp, take your pick from optical or coaxial digital and RCA or XLR analogue. Throw in a control bus link, RS232 socket and trigger out for multi-room system control and it's hard to see how the 851D could be any better equipped. With the supplied remote control offering a switchable volume control there may be no need to add a pre-amp at all*. Just add a power amp or active speakers and you're all set to go.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBLUETOOTH CONNECTED\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSupplied with the Cambridge Audio BT100 Bluetooth dongle, the 851D even accommodates Bluetooth music transfers from your smartphone, tablet, laptop or other compatible devices. Whilst this may not offer quite the quality of other streaming sources, it's enormously handy to have when playing background music. Thanks to A2DP plus aptX support the quality is also extremely high by Bluetooth standards.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSUPERIOR COMPONENTS FOR SUPERB SOUND\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAt the heart of the 851D are two Analogue Devices AD1955 24-bit DACs in dual differential formation. Each DAC handles just one channel for excellent stereo imaging, operating fully in differential mode for exceptionally low distortion and noise. What this equates to for the listener is an exceptionally unforced, natural sound quality. Instruments and vocals \"breath\" with emotion and depth. Rather than sounding grey and mechanical, the Azur 851D uses colour, texture and fluidity of sound to create a sense of realism often lost on DACs of this price.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tATF2 AUDIO UPSAMPLING FOR A SMOOTHER SOUND\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe high quality DACs are complemented by a new Anagram Technologies ATF2 24 bit/384 kHz up-sampling circuit. Up-sampling lower resolution sources \"stretches\" them to give the highest resolution possible. It also aids standard 24-bit/192kHz recordings with a faster sampling rate for less jitter. Up-sampling sound gives a smoother, more relaxed sound quality with added detail. You'll also notice enhanced depth of sound and a more natural quality without the \"edge\" that can afflict digital music. You'll hear every detail, including the odd cough, squeaky chair and flutter of sheet music; in short, it's like being there for real!\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTAILORED SOUND\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAs we all prefer slightly different nuances of sound quality, the 851D comes with Cambridge Audio's triple filter system. Select from Linear Phase, Minimal Phase or Steep modes and you can subtly alter the sound quality. You might even find certain types of music sound better with a particular filter engaged.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFULL METAL CASING WITH EXTENSIVE DAMPING\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tUsing a full metal casing, with rounded edges, doesn't just look and feel good, it helps the sound, too. The case is rigid and well-damped, meaning that it won't resonate unhelpfully. The thick aluminium front panel looks the part and also acts as a shield against electrical interference from sources such as dimmers and RF devices. All these details combine to create a DAC that not only looks stylish but also offers exceptional resistance to both mechanical and electrical interference.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tUnequivocally the best DAC we've ever sold, with a level of connectivity that also puts it in a class of its own, the Cambridge Audio 851D is the ultimate heart of your digital system.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t*Conventional pre-amplifier required if connecting analogue sources to your system; such as turntable, tuner or cassette deck plus CD players without digital output.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOverview :\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tHi-Fi+ (GB, September 2014)\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\"Few DACs come close to the 851 D's range of features; especially Bluetooth, which could be a significant factor in its success in the market place today.\"\n\t\t\n\t\t\tStereophile (US, December 2014)\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tStereophile (US, December 2014)\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\"The Cambridge Audio Azur 851D has bang for the buck all over the place.

Class A amplification delivers the purest possible sound, using only one transistor to conduct, but can be energy inefficient. Class AB involves both transistors conducting simultaneously, but makes it impossible to maintain a balance of low crossover distortion and power efficiency. Our Class XD system operates in both Class A and Class AB mode, dynamically moving the crossover point depending on the audio output volume. This combines the near zero crossover distortion of pure Class A with improved efficiency of Class AB at higher volumes, without any compromises in performance for the best of both world.\n\n\tSerious power – 200W into 8 Ohms stereo mode is serious power. But for those with bigger plans, the 851W is usable in a mono bridged configuration with each amplifier delivering 500W RMS.\n\n\tTwo toroidal transformers – Separate, high-end transformers for the power amplifier and input and other circuitry ensure audio performance is unaffected by the dramatic current output swings required to drive demanding speakers, by keeping power supplies entirely separate.\n\n\tTerrapin impedance buffering modules – Cambridge Audio's proprietary modules replace the op-amps commonly found in similar amplifiers. At the critical low level gain stages, these offer far improved stereo separation and imaging – unheard of at this price point.\n\n\tCAP5 proprietary protection – Protects the integrity of your system by avoiding DC spikes, overheating, short circuits or clipping.\n\n\tIntegration – Smart auto-standby mode detects incoming audio signals to simplify integration with Cambridge Audio preamplifiers.\n\n\tAll-metal chassis  – Including extensive use of aluminium to create massive structural rigidity, careful damping and control of acoustic resonance.\n\n\t \n\n\tFeatures :\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCambridge Audio's Class XD amplification with 12 output transistors per channel combines the best of Class A and AB amplification\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeparate toroidal transformers for power amp and input/other circuitry\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCambridge Audio's Terrapin impedance buffering modules – separating amplifier and signal impedance\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t200W into 8 Ohms stereo mode or 500W RMS per amp mono bridged mode\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCambridge Audio's CAP5 protection from DC spikes, overheating, clipping etc.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<0.5W smart auto-standby mode for integration with preamplifiers\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAll metal chassis with premium components, creating massive structural rigidity, careful damping and control of acoustic resonance.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRemote Control – Compatible with the entire 851 range\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\tReviews\n\n\tAndrew Everard\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \"Simply, this is one of the most transparent, thrilling and richly rewarding amplifier combinations I have encountered, with fine grip on the speakers with which it’s used, vast amounts of information delivered and never even the slightest sense of the music being held back or sold short.\"\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUK, Summer 2014\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpecifications\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPower output – stereo/mono\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t200W per channel into 8 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t350W per channel into 4 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPower output – bridged mono\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t500W 8 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t800W 4 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTHD (unweighted)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t< 0.001% 1 kHz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t< 0.005% 20 Hz -

These amplifiers will help you discover a new dimension of sound. The CXA80 must be heard to be believed. Rated at 80 Watts per channel, its class AB amplifier design will reveal spectacular detail in your music. Separate dual mono windings on a low-flux toroidal transformer further enhance performance and together these design details deliver incredible control over your speakers on a wide, enveloping, captivating sound stage.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo journey deeper into the music you love, the CXA80 has been designed from the ground up with built-in digital to analogue conversion capabilities. Using a high-specification 24-bit/192kHz WM8740 DAC chip from Wolfson, the CXA80 offers a powerful upgrade for all your digital sources. And because we’ve designed it with digital in mind, it features two optical inputs, a co-axial digital input and an asynchronous USB Audio socket, so you can play your music directly from your PC or Mac. Add an optional BT100 Bluetooth dongle and you’ve got aptX streaming direct from your smartphone or tablet, allowing access to music from Spotify, Youtube, and a host of others.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnalogue sources are equally well catered for with balanced XLR inputs, RCA inputs and a front 3.5mm aux jack. In use, the CXA80 is a delight. The floating effect of the chassis, the brushed finish, and the easy-to-read front panel, all create an amplifier that’s as beautiful on the outside as it’s well engineered on the inside.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhatever your source, the CXA80 will reveal new depths and layers of sound, letting you re-discover your favourite music.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChoosing the DAC\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBoth our CXA60 and CXA80 amplifiers employ the same Wolfson WM8740 DAC, and there’s a very good reason for that: it sounds superb! There are more recent Wolfson DACs in circulation, however none sound quite as great as the WM8740 in our view. Which is why, time and again, we choose them.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo-into-one transformer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CXA80 utilises two separate windings on the oversize toroidal transformer. In effect, this is like having two toroidal transformers wound onto one chassis, providing separate windings for each amplification module. If you get a huge transient in the right channel, it won’t unsettle what’s going on in the left. The current is being drawn from a different path, rather than a common path, so the output is stable and remains unflustered, whether your liking is for Little Richard or Lamb of God.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDynamic Thermal Tracking transistors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe transistors used by the CXA80 are not your usual common or garden offerings. They come with an integrated Dynamic Thermal Tracking System. So what does this mean? Normally a Power Output transistor utilises a thermo-coupler attached directly to the heat sink of the amp; this informs the system so that it can rebias when key temperatures are reached. However, using Integrated Dynamic Thermal tracking provides a far more accurate reading of the real temperature of a transistor, and relays it faster too because it’s not a delayed heating effect. This enables us to bias the amplifier more accurately and in almost real time. Which means your CXA80 is always running at optimum performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMusical Subwoofer output\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you want to use a subwoofer as part of your speaker complement, the CXA80 doesn’t penalise you for it. Because we want to ensure there’s no unnecessary high frequency noise affecting the subwoofer, we’ve put the output filter at 3KHz. This is high enough to prevent any phase shift associated with the low pass filter affecting what happens below 200Hz. The result is a phase linear subwoofer output signal which is clean and musical.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReinventing the signal path\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CX range represents a step change in the way our engineers have approached signal path design, and the result is one of our most musical and entertaining amplifiers yet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPreviously, we went to almost surgical lengths to minimise distortion in order to get the best results. This invariably meant 46 components sat in the signal path. For the CX Series, we wanted to dramatically reduce that component count. The CXA80 now has only 24 components in the signal path. The big difference is that there are now 500 support components as well. Their job is to guarantee those 24 key components are absolutely optimal all the time, regardless of mains fluctuations and other influences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis has made a big difference when it comes to tuning. Previously, tweaking one of the 46 components only made a small difference and it was sometimes difficult to quantify exactly what difference any change made. With the CX series, those 24 components have now actually become quite critical. Changing just one affects the character of the amplifier.We can hear very clearly what each of those components is doing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis revision has fundamentally changed the character of the amplifier. Listening to a CX series amplifier is fun, engaging and exciting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh resolution asynchronous USB\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn order to offer 24-bit 192kHz resolution via asynchronous USB we use a specialist XMOS device dedicated to the USB input. We’ve also written a custom driver to allow PC users to access the higher sample rates available in USB Audio 2 mode. This bespoke code allows us to stream audio files at the highest possible resolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBespoke Bluetooth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you want to use your CXA80 with a Bluetooth source, we offer an optional BT100 audio receiver. To ensure that this does not interfere with other components in the amplifier, it’s isolated internally on the digital input board. From the ground up, this is an audiophile Bluetooth device. All the coding for the BT100, including the aptX implementation, is done in-house. We even include an extension cable which enables you get the best Bluetooth range.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmbracing classic design\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSometimes there’s a good reason to keep things uncomplicated. The CXA80 features a high-quality damped metal chassis, designed to ensure that nothing rattles or interferes with the electronics. We’ve also kept volume control simple. The CXA80 uses a logarithmic ALPS pot. And when it comes to switching inputs, the CXA80 uses relay switching with silver plated contacts. This classic approach is still the best way to move signals around, rather than with transistors or electronic switches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnical Specifications :\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPower output: 80W RMS into 8 Ohms, 120W RMS into 4 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDAC: Wolfson WM8740\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrequency Response: <5Hz– 60kHz +/-1dB\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnalogue audio inputs 1x balanced XLR, 4 x RCA, 1 x 3.5mm MP3 input (front panel)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital audio inputs: 1 x S/PDIF coaxial, 2 x TOSLINK optical, 1 x USB audio, Bluetooth via BT100 (not supplied)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCompatibility: TOSLINK optical, S/PDIF coaxial, USB 1.0 and 2.0, BT100 Bluetooth receiver\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOutputs: Speakers A+B, 3.5mm headphone, Preamp Output, Subwoofer Output\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMax power consumption: 750W\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStandby power consumption: <0.5W\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDimensions (H x W x D)*: 115 x 430 x 341mm (4.5 x 16.9 x 13.4”)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWeight: 8.7kg (19.1lbs)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReviews :\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMusic Emotion  (NL, July 2015)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Twee indrukwekkend goede apparaten.

Class A amplification delivers the purest possible sound, using only one transistor to conduct, but can be energy inefficient. Class AB involves both transistors conducting simultaneously, but makes it impossible to maintain a balance of low crossover distortion and power efficiency. Our Class XD system operates in both Class A and Class AB mode, dynamically moving the crossover point depending on the audio output volume. This combines the near zero crossover distortion of pure Class A with improved efficiency of Class AB at higher volumes, without any compromises in performance for the best of both world.\n\n\tSerious power – 200W into 8 Ohms stereo mode is serious power. But for those with bigger plans, the 851W is usable in a mono bridged configuration with each amplifier delivering 500W RMS.\n\n\tTwo toroidal transformers – Separate, high-end transformers for the power amplifier and input and other circuitry ensure audio performance is unaffected by the dramatic current output swings required to drive demanding speakers, by keeping power supplies entirely separate.\n\n\tTerrapin impedance buffering modules – Cambridge Audio's proprietary modules replace the op-amps commonly found in similar amplifiers. At the critical low level gain stages, these offer far improved stereo separation and imaging – unheard of at this price point.\n\n\tCAP5 proprietary protection – Protects the integrity of your system by avoiding DC spikes, overheating, short circuits or clipping.\n\n\tIntegration – Smart auto-standby mode detects incoming audio signals to simplify integration with Cambridge Audio preamplifiers.\n\n\tAll-metal chassis – Including extensive use of aluminium to create massive structural rigidity, careful damping and control of acoustic resonance.\n\n\t \n\n\tFeatures :\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCambridge Audio's Class XD amplification with 12 output transistors per channel combines the best of Class A and AB amplification\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSeparate toroidal transformers for power amp and input/other circuitry\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCambridge Audio's Terrapin impedance buffering modules – separating amplifier and signal impedance\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t200W into 8 Ohms stereo mode or 500W RMS per amp mono bridged mode\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCambridge Audio's CAP5 protection from DC spikes, overheating, clipping etc.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<0.5W smart auto-standby mode for integration with preamplifiers\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAll metal chassis with premium components, creating massive structural rigidity, careful damping and control of acoustic resonance.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRemote Control – Compatible with the entire 851 range\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\tReviews\n\n\tAndrew Everard\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\"Simply, this is one of the most transparent, thrilling and richly rewarding amplifier combinations I have encountered, with fine grip on the speakers with which it’s used, vast amounts of information delivered and never even the slightest sense of the music being held back or sold short.\"\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUK, Summer 2014\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpecifications\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPower output – stereo/mono\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t200W per channel into 8 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t350W per channel into 4 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPower output – bridged mono\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t500W 8 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t800W 4 Ohms\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTHD (unweighted)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t< 0.001% 1 kHz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t< 0.005% 20 Hz - 20 kHz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrequency response\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5Hz – 80kHz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tS/N ratio (ref 1W / 8 Ohn)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t>90dB (unweighted)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSensitivity – stereo or mono\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.5V rms unbalanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.5 + 1.5V rms balanced\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSensitivity – bridged mono\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0.775V rms unbalanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0.775V + 0.775V rms balanced\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInput impedances\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBalanced input 38 kOhm\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnbalanced input 68 kOhm\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPower Amp damping factor\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t> 110 at 1 kHz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax. power consumption\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2400W\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStandby power consumption\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStandby <0.5W\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDimensions (H x W x D)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t148 x 430 x 365mm (5.8 x 16.9 x 14.4”)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWeight\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t19.1kg (42.2lbs)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\tRevel Concerta 2 F36\n\n\t \n\n\tThe Concerta2 F36 floorstanding loudspeaker was designed to deliver outstanding accuracy over a remarkably wide frequency range.

A headphone jack on the front completes the unit and makes this one of the most versatile and compelling products on the market for 2016.\n\t\n\tSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tModel\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCS-55A\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency Response\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tKT88: 5Hz - 44kHz (-3dB)\n\t\t\t\tEL34: 5Hz - 48kHz (-3dB)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBezel\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSilver or Black\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tS/N Ratio\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t92dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDimensions in mm (W x H x D)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t360 x 334 x 180\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOutput Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t4 ohms, 8 ohms\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPower Output\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tKT88:22W Triode - 40W Ultralinear\n\t\t\t\tEL34: 20W Triode - 38W Ultralinear\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Terminal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUSB, CD, Phono Aux\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPower Consumption\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<270w\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Sensitivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tKT88: 270mV\n\t\t\t\tEL34: 280mV\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNet Weight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t22kg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t100K Ohms\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tUSB DAC:\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWord Length\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t16-32 Bits\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOperating System\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWindows XP, Vista, 7, 8, Mac OS (10.6.3 or above)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCompatible with Audio Class 1.0 and Audio Class 2.0\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSampling Rate\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t44.1kHz\n\t\t\t\t48kHz\n\t\t\t\t88.2kHz\n\t\t\t\t96kHz\n\t\t\t\t176kHz\n\t\t\t\t192kHz\n\t\t\t\t352.8kHz\n\t\t\t\t384kHz\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\tPHONO:\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Sensitivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3mV Input\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRIAA Errors\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLower Than +-0.25dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tS/N Ratio\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t68dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tImpedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t47k ohms\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTotal Gain\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t40dB\n\t\t\n\t\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2163/1/CS55ATube.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2163/2/1316571988.png","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2163/3/1316578021.png","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2163/4/1316579338.png"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2191","curve":"Cayin CS-55CD CD Player","curve_URL1":"","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2191/1/CS-55CD.jpg","curve2":"The Cayin CS-55CD is a stand-alone hybrid tube CD player developed to partner with the CS, MA and LA series integrated amplifiers.

Miniature devices need miniature connections and stereo mini-jack sockets often double up as optical digital outputs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe new Chord C-lite optical cable is available fitted with a specially designed optical mini jack connection thats been purpose built for use with miniature players, yes there are adaptors but a properly terminated cable will work so much better, The C-lite range features mini jack to mini jack, mini jack to Toslink and Toslink all available in a wide range of sizes; from pocket size portable up to longer lengths for use in home systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Chord C-lite uses a wide bandwidth PMA optical cable the ends of which have been polished to improve bandwidth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe central conductor is protected by an internal jacket of soft PVC which is then covered with a hard skin PVC outer jacket. This helps to prevent crush damage and is flexible enough to allow a tight bend radius without affecting the light carrier.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1506/1/C-Lite.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1506/2/chord-c-lite-toslink-mojo-72.png","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1506/3/chordclite.png","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1587","curve":"Chord C Screen Speaker Cable ","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=promo","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1587/1/Chord_C-Screen_Speaker_Cable_Per_Metre37760-1.jpg_3.jpg","curve2":"C-screen is a brand new shielded speaker cable aimed at both audio and home cinema systems.

It includes oxygen-free copper conductors and is optimally used with front-end components such as CD players, streamers and the like. Plugs are gold-plated while strain relief has been applied to the plug’s terminations. You can buy the cable in either 1m or half metre lengths. \n\n\t \n\n\tSound Quality\n\n\t \n\n\tDiving straight into sound testing for the 1m interconnect cable, I also pulled out my first budget cable reference, the Epiphany Atratus II priced at £65/m. I turned to Venice Blue from Bobby Darin on vinyl. \n\n\tThe Chords had an immediate impact on the dynamic range, stretching it to new extremes as the upper mids were extended, allowing the Darin vocal delivery to become expansive and to reach further. Similarly, the bass was now more recognisable with the bass guitar offering a richer ‘twang’ with greater power and heft to the instrument. \n\n\tThe strings which flowed throughout the song sounded particular free and sweeping during the introductory portion of the song, providing more emotion while the secondary percussion was able to provide a secure rhythmic support. \n\n\tIn general terms, the song exhibted greater transparency in its presentation, almost as if a curtain had been lifted from the front of the speakers. This gave the soundstage a clearer and more natural effect. Darin now sounded at ease in his performance. \n\n\tTurning to a more dynamic genre of music and The Who song, Baba O’Riley on CD, The Chords were, this time, compared to the rather more expensive Epiphany Atratus III cables (priced at £100/m). Compared to the latter, the Chords were slighter warmer in tone. This could be immediately heard during the complex introductory synth section of the song. \n\n\tAdded warmth in budget cables does not detract from synth replay, however, which bodes well if you are fan of this genre. The introductory piano retained the power of the Atratus III but lacked a touch of upper mid extension while the drums retained a heft with a reassuring weighty mass that gave the track a solid foundation. \n\n\tWhen the song reached the Pete Townshend vocal break, midway through the song, the Atratus III cables were noticeable in adding a slight touch of upper mid bloom during crescendos. The Chords never suffered from this problem. The added warmth and the slightly lower midrange extension just pulled back from the edge meaning that there was no bloom effect. The same could be said for a later sequence during Roger Daltrey’s crescendos.  \n\n\tThe Chord warmth had pros and cons for jazz. Playing Dexter Gordon's I Was Doing all Right, the tonal direction of the Chords allowed both the sax and trumpet solos to flow with ease, despite a slight restriction in the dynamic range when compared to the Atratus III reference.\n\n\tAccompanying percussion confirmed this effect because, while the rim shots remained powerful, they lacked a touch of sharpness while the  cymbals produced more of a warm fuzz than a clear cloud of shimmer. Despite this slight midrange recess of the Chords affecting the treble options of the song, the attractive warmth of the lower mids and upper bass was ideal for harder rocking tracks. High energy music was never grating or bright while guitar solos packed both power and force. \n\n\t \n\n\tConclusion\n\n\t \n\n\tThe Chord C-line provides a far superior sonic replay to basic, bundled cables and even trounces more expensive, audiophile designs. It’s only when we get to cables at twice the price that a slight midrange and treble recess appears which may give fans of jazz and singer-songwriters pause for thought. Nevertheless, this cable is highly recommended for budget use. Above that, as shown by the reference Atratus III reference, you will need to seek a careful demonstration.\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/924/1/chordc-line.png","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/924/2/1012.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/924/3/th_DSC03244_LR5.jpg","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1371","curve":"Chord C-view Hdmi Ultra-slim High Speed 1,5m","curve_URL1":"","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1371/1/UntitledChordC-view-1.jpg","curve2":"\nDeskripsi Produk\n\nHigh speed 1080p 3D compliant HDMI cable\nSupports 4k TV and deep colour\nEthernet/audio return\nSupports all HDMI audio formats\nDie-cast gold-plated plug\nSilver-plated oxygen free copper signal conductors\nRe-designed, reduced length HDMI plug for easy connection to wall mounted screens\n\nUltra flexible 4.5mm cable for ease of installation\nAvailable in 0.75m, 1.5m, 2m and 3m lengths\n","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 650.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1371","Title":"","Text":"\n\t\n\t\tDeskripsi Produk\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\tChord C-view Hdmi Ultra-slim High Speed 1,5m\n\t\n\t\tBerat : 500gr\n\t\n\t\tHigh speed 1080p 3D compliant HDMI cable\n\t\tSupports 4k TV and deep colour\n\t\tEthernet/audio return\n\t\tSupports all HDMI audio formats\n\t\tDie-cast gold-plated plug\n\t\tSilver-plated oxygen free copper signal conductors\n\t\tRe-designed, reduced length HDMI plug for easy connection to wall mounted screens\n\t\t\n\t\tUltra flexible 4.5mm cable for ease of installation\n\t\tAvailable in 0.75m, 1.5m, 2m and 3m lengths\n\t\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1371/1/UntitledChordC-view-1.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1371/2/ChordC-view00000000000000.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1371/3/Cordc-view.jpg11111111111.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1371/4/Cordc-view.jpg222222222.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=541","curve":"Chord Chameleon VEE 3 stereo RCA interconnect (1 m)","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=fivestar","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/541/1/8178245403_062ec12d2f_b.jpg","curve2":"Take Cobra VEE3 and improve it – that’s what we’ve done with the Chameleon VEE3 range.

The Crimson VEE 3 works really and is a cost effective solution when it comes to considering the long runs of cable often needed for subwoofer connections. - See more at: http://www.chord.co.uk/product/chord-crimson-vee-3-rca-subwoofer-cable/#sthash.gkFkisZz.dpuf\n\n\t\n\t\t“Great balance between cost and performance, the highly effective shielding means that really long lengths are not a problem.”\n\t\n\t\tWhatever the level of home cinema system you have, the subwoofer plays a crucial role in bringing the proper home cinema experience into your living room.\n\t\n\t\tThe high quality shielding and twin conductor configuration of the Crimson VEE 3 cable will help to properly define and articulate the signal fed to your subwoofer. This may seem like something important for music, (it is), but it’s just as important for films as well.\n\t\n\t\tThe VEE 3 RCA plug plays a part as well, the direct gold-plated contact helping to ensure the best signal transfer and bring an extra degree of precision to each piece of subwoofer drama.\n\t- See more at: http://www.chord.co.uk/product/chord-crimson-vee-3-rca-subwoofer-cable/#sthash.gkFkisZz.dpuf\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/715/1/crimsonvee3sub.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/715/2/221.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/715/3/chord-crimson-pack.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/715/4/Capture.JPG"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=451","curve":"Chord Epic singel wire (tanpa banana plug)","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=fivestar","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/451/1/epic.jpg","curve2":"Chord Epic speaker cable\n\n2mm diameter silver-plated oxygen free copper conductors\n\nTwisted pair configuration, Silicone internal jacket\n\nHigh frequency effective dual foil and braid shielding system\n\nVibration damping translucent PVC outer jacket\n\nAvailable in single wire configurations","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 1.500.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=451","Title":"Chord Epic singel wire (tanpa banana plug)","Text":"\n\tChord Epic speaker cable technical information\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\tChord Epic Twin speaker cable\n\n\tCONDUCTORS: 2 x 12 AWG multi-stranded silver-plated oxygen free copper.\n\n\tCONFIGURATION: Twisted pair configuration.\n\n\tCONDUCTOR INSULATION: PTFE. We believe that to obtain the most neutral tonal characteristic from silver-plated conductors it is vital to use PTFE insulation.

COLOUR: Translucent brown.\n\n\tAPPLICATIONS: Epic takes its conductors from Odyssey and its shielding from Signature speaker cable. The shielding brings big improvements not just to high frequencies but also the bass frequencies. There is space around individual instruments and the true timbre of instruments is easy to hear. Violins, cellos and violas sound more realistic, likewise pianos.  Epic is very compatible and will work well with almost every system.\n\n\t \n\n\tChord Epic speaker cable is the result of a successful marriage of two of our award winning speaker cables.  The silver-plated oxygen free copper conductors, PTFE insulation and silicone surround are borrowed from Chord Odyssey speaker cable and the shielding system is taken from the Chord Signature speaker cable.  The development and success of Signature speaker cable proved conclusively that shielding speaker cable could bring some serious improvements to sound quality.  The lessons learned during its development means that we can now apply the same principles to other cables within the Chord range.  Chord Epic is a highly effective shielded cable with many of the performance characteristics of the more expensive Chord Signature. \n\n\tFitting shielding systems to speaker cables can bring the same sort of benefits to the sound\n\tof a system that improving the shields on interconnects does.  The reduction and the level of perceived noise means that very fine dynamic and tonal information is easily heard and brings improvements not only to the high frequency performance of a system, but also the bass and mid frequencies.  The space around notes and the extra harmonic content that Epic can bring to a system is really surprising.  The complex harmonic information that makes up the timbre of stringed and bowed instruments is carried extremely accurately.\n\n\tThe lower noise floor also makes micro dynamic information easier to hear and it is simpler to follow, understand and become more involved with, even the most complex pieces of music.\n\n\tUse it with:  Chord Cadenza, Chord Chorus 2 , Chord Anthem 2 and Chord Signet\n\n\tInstallation:\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTerminating Chord Epic speaker cable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEpic Twin (2 core)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

It provides the perfect balance of lightness, stiffness and damping that, combined with its new strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system, reproduces midrange and bass frequencies in perfect balance.\n\n\tThe whole diaphragm is made from one piece of MSP. Rather than gluing on a dust cap or just leaving a hole, this construction makes the cone far more rigid – and means far less physical distortion. It gives a much better physical connection to the voice-coil, which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm via the Balance Ribs around the centre.\n\n\tEvoke 20’s 52mm voice-coil is made from aluminium. We chose that over copper for this speaker because it gives the correct balance of weight and winding height to give bass frequencies power and enough mechanical and electrical damping, while also letting midrange frequencies (where a vast amount of musical detail lies) sing through clearly.\n\n\tA Nomex spider keeps everything centred and moving the way it should, while the new, seamless Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater power and punch.\n\n\tThe all-new Cerotar tweeter\n\tThe tweeter is brand new. It’s called Cerotar, and is based on key technologies from our award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter and the mighty new Esotar3, which you’ll find in the top-of-the-line Confidence series.\n\n\tLike all our other tweeters, it’s a 28mm unit and uses a precision-coated soft dome. This coating is applied in exactly the correct places and thicknesses to optimise high-frequency performance – it’s a process derived from the development of our most exclusive speakers.\n\n\tBut that’s where the similarity to everything except Confidence ends. Hidden behind the dome is a part called the Hexis: a special inner dome that shapes airflow to smooth-out the frequency response and eliminate unwanted resonances that would affect high-frequency performance.\n\n\tAs with the Esotec+ woofer, it’s driven by a new strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet for increased sensitivity, improved detail resolution and a natural, dynamic response.\n\n\tThat’s all a posh way of saying “it sounds really sweet, and you can listen to it for hours without even a hint of fatigue”. Time to get those prog-rock quadruple gatefold albums out of the attic…\n\n\tA design for life\n\tOur design department took field trips to show-homes, home-interiors stores and real-life dwellings in Denmark to hone Evoke 20’s look. It was important for them to be able to imagine the speakers in a variety of living spaces – because, after all, that’s how most people listen. They’re on a couch, with a coffee, and a dog… these speakers had to be hygge.\n\n\tThat’s why the four finishes are so relatable. You can choose from Black High Gloss and White High Gloss (which both use new lacquering techniques for a stunning glass-like surface), as well as the warm and organic open-veneered Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood styles.\n\n\tThe cabinets themselves are tapered and rounded in a nod to the Contour and Confidence ranges. The mounting screws are hidden behind stylish one-piece trim rings. And because good design doesn’t age, you know they’ll look every bit as stylish when you’re still listening to them in 30 years.\n\n\t\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1976/1/Evoke20RevisiAC.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1976/2/evoke_20_black_front.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1976/3/g345EV20BG-F.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1976/4/g345EV20BG-M.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1979","curve":"DYNAUDIO EVOKE 25C CENTER SPEAKER","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1979/1/EVOKE25C.jpg","curve2":"oing to the movies is much better at home.

You can choose from Black High Gloss and White High Gloss (which both use new lacquering techniques for a stunning glass-like surface), as well as the warm and organic open-veneered Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood styles.\n\n\tThe cabinet is tapered and rounded in a nod to the Contour and Confidence ranges, while the mounting screws are hidden behind stylish one-piece trim rings.\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1979/1/EVOKE25C.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1979/2/dynaudio_evoke_25c_blonde_wood_03.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1979/3/evoke_25c_black_halfprofile28129.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1979/4/evoke_25c_walnut_wood_front.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1977","curve":"DYNAUDIO EVOKE 30 STANDINGFLOOR SPEAKER","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/1/Evoke30RevisiAC.jpg","curve2":"Put a pair of floorstanders in your living room and even the least ‘hi-fi’ person in the world will know you mean business.

And it’s one of our most sophisticated yet.\n\n\tOur engineers plundered some of our most celebrated technologies – including ingenious airflow systems from the award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter, the precision coating found on the Contour range and the Hexis from the new Confidence series (more on that in a bit) – and combined them into a new design specifically for the Evoke family.\n\n\tThe Cerotar is driven by a newly-designed strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system, and features the Confidence’s headline-grabbing Hexis inner dome. This ingenious little dimpled device sits right behind the soft tweeter diaphragm and reduces unwanted resonances while smoothing out the overall frequency response. The result is sweeter treble, better detail and even more clarity – and that means you can listen into the wee hours of the morning without fatigue.\n\n\tThe low-down on woofers\n\tEvoke 30’s twin 14cm Esotec+ mid/bass drivers are made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a material we’ve been using for our woofer diaphragms since Dynaudio started back in 1977. It provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to balance the needs of powerful yet precise bass performance with clear, detailed midrange.\n\n\tEach speaker cone is made from a single piece of MSP. This makes them exactly the right amount of rigid – and means far less physical distortion when they’re playing. It also gives a super-solid physical connection to the glass-fibre voice-coil former on the back (it’s glued directly under the Balance Ribs you’ll see around the centre), which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm.\n\n\tEvoke 30's 52mm voice-coils are made from aluminium – which provides the correct mix of weight and winding height to balance bass and midrange frequencies. It gives optimum moving mass while retaining the right grip of midrange performance for a perfectly integrated performance.\n\n\tNomex spiders keep everything centred and moving the way it should, while the new Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater punch. And, like the Cerotar tweeter, Evoke 30’s woofers are both driven by ceramic Ferrite+ magnets for greater control, finesse and power.\n\n\tIn non-speaker-designer language, that means “you’ll hear your music the way it was meant to be heard”. No rough edges, nothing standing out where it shouldn’t – and nothing relegated to a supporting act when it should be headlining.\n\n\tTimeless Danish design\n\tEvoke has been created for real life. Our designers’ priority was to make the whole family look great in any listening environment. They took models and prototypes home and sat with them, went and scoured interior-design stores and specialist furniture retailers and even sniffed around real houses to gain inspiration.\n\n\tEvoke 30 is available in four fantastic finishes. Black High Gloss and White High Gloss both use a new lacquering technique that gives a gloriously deep, glass-like look. At the other end of the tactile spectrum are the lovely, natural open veneers of Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood – honest, organic and hygge.\n\n\tThe result is an instant classic. It’s modern, retro, timeless and cutting-edge all at once. It’s the kind of speaker your kids will eye-up expectantly when they’re leaving for university.\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/1/Evoke30RevisiAC.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/2/FEATURESEVOKE30.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/3/g345EV30BG-F.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/4/g345EV30BG-B.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1978","curve":"DYNAUDIO EVOKE 50 STANDINGFLOOR SPEAKER","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1978/1/DYNAUDIOEVOKE50.jpg","curve2":"If a pair of Evoke 50s in a room doesn’t say “statement of intent”, we don’t know what does.

These high-end active speakers bring true high-resolution wireless streaming, from every conceivable source, to your home.\n\nSend in a digital signal (wired or wireless, it’s your choice), and it’ll stay that way right up until the last possible moment – meaning it stays pure all the way from the recording studio to the speaker driver.\n\nThere’s no clutter, no fuss… and no catch.","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 142.000.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1994","Title":"DYNAUDIO FOCUS 30XD Floorstanding Speaker","Text":"\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\tTechnical specifications\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpecification sheet for Focus XD part 2\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnalogue Inputs:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1 x RCA per speaker\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital Inputs/Outputs:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1 x RCA input 1 x RCA output\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWireless:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccepts up to 24bit / 96kHz (Connect Box)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequency Response (±3dB):\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t29Hz - 24kHz\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBox Principle:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBass Reflex Rear Ported\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCrossover:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2½ way DSP Based\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCrossover Frequencies:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t(300), 4000Hz\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWoofer:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t17cm MSP\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMidrange:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t17cm MSP\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTweeter:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t28mm soft dome\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpecification sheet for Focus XD part 1\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmplifier Power:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3 x 150W\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAC Power Input:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t100-240 V 50/60Hz\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStandby Power Consumption:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t< 0.5W\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaximum Power Consumption:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t200W\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWeight:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t18,5kg / 40lb\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions (W x H x D):\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t198 x 980 x 307mm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t7.8 x 38.6 x 12.1in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions with feet/grill (W x H x D):\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t256 x 998 x 328mm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10.1 x 39.3 x 12.9in\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\thttp://video.dynaudio.com/whats-an-active-crossover\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1994/1/dynaudiofocus30xd.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1994/2/dynaudio-focus-30xd-walnut.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1994/3/focus_30_xd_hg_walnut.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1994/4/focus_30_xd_hg_walnut_back.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1995","curve":"DYNAUDIO FOCUS 60XD Floorstanding Speaker","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1995/1/focus60xdrevisi.jpg","curve2":"The Focus 60 XD is for those seeking the best possible audio performance and completely uncompromised sound quality\n\nThe 600W floorstanding Focus 60 XDs are the ultimate union of quality, power and performance.

Unlike the vast majority of solid state volume controls that typically introduce dozens of resistors in the signal path, the Diablo 300 employs no more than two for any given level setting.\n\n\tThe extreme wideband frequency response of the Diablo 300 extends from 0.5 Hz to 350 kHz and its prodigious 300 Watt (8 Ohms) power output capability represents a significant increase over the original Diablo. The extreme high current capability of the Diablo 300 allows it to double its output to 600 Watts in a 4 Ohm load and deliver a massive 950 Watts into 2 Ohms.\n\n\tAs these numbers confirm, the Gryphon Diablo 300 will remain rock solid when confronted with even the most viciously reactive loudspeaker loads.\n\n\tDiablo 300 maintains a power reservoir capacity of 68,000 microFarad and employs local active shunt regulators for superior noise suppression compared to the Zener diode regulated low-voltage supplies of the original Diablo.\n\n\tBecause it operates without negative feedback, the Gryphon Diablo 300 avoids both the intrinsic time-delay caused by sending the output signal to the input for a comparator loop and the resulting intermodulation distortion between time-offset signals.\n\t\n\tVinyl Digital Option\n\t\n\t\tAt the time of original purchase or as the need arises at a later date, Gryphon Diablo 300 can be fitted with a specially designed Gryphon DAC PCM/DSD module based on the innovative, award-winning Gryphon Kalliope digital-to- analogue converter. The module adds five digital inputs (USB, balanced AES 115 Ω, optical and dual S/PDIF 75 Ω). USB can process PCM up to 32-bit/384 kHz as well as DSD (Windows OS up to DSD512, Mac OS up to DSD128, Linux OS up to DSD128 DoP).\n\t\n\t\tThe remaining digital connections can handle PCM up to 24-bit/192 kHz.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\tThis future-proof digital module is ready for any current or foreseeable high resolution digital format.\n\t\n\t\tAnd, in the finest Gryphon tradition, the Diablo 300 offers the option of an exceptional MM/MC phonostage for the dedicated enthusiasts who continue to enjoy the musical treasures etched in the grooves of the long-playing, black vinyl disc.\n\t\t\n\t\tStyle and Easy to Use\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDespite its substantial size and heft, the satin black, brushed aluminium chassis and gleaming black acrylic faceplate of the Gryphon Diablo 300 exude luxurious elegance that will enhance any interior.

The stylish feel and look of the sandblasted, anodised aluminium disc tray conveys the reliability and stability of this rock-steady, precisely calibrated mechanism.\n\n\tThe fit and finish of the Gryphon Scorpio is classic Gryphon in its subdued elegance and timeless beauty.\n\t \n\n\tSPECIFICATIONS:\n\t- Balanced Analog/DAC Circuit: YES\n\t- Converters: 4x 32bit/192KHz\n\t- Formats: PCM\n\t- Output Balanced, max: 4.0Vrms\n\t- S/N Unweighted, 20-20000hZ: <-103dB\n\t- S/N weighted, A-Weighted: <-107dB\n\t- Distortion (THD+N): 0.0035%\n\t- Channel Separation: Infinite\n\t- Digital balanced output: 1x BNC (SPDIF)\n\t- Analog output impedance: (20-20000Hz): 20Ohm\n\t- Balanced analog outputs, pr.channel: 1x XLR\n\t- Bandwidth (-3dB0, max: 0-96KHz\n\t- Power Consumption Stand by: 5W\n\t- Power Consumption (Maximum): 40W\n\t- Power Consumption (Idle): 35W\n\t- Dimensions in cm W x H x D: 48 x 13.5 x 41.5\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2249/1/ScorpioS.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2249/2/2-2.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2249/3/1-1-1-1.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2249/4/3-2.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2362","curve":"Harbeth P3ESR XD Bookshelf Speaker made in england","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2362/1/P3ESROliveAshAC.jpg","curve2":"*Jika mengalami kendala pengiriman karena ongkos kirim yang mahal, bisa menggunakan ekspedisi rekanan kami, cara-nya langsung chat saja ke admin Tokopedia.\n\nHarbeth’s development team has, once again, redefined what is possible from this use anywhere loudspeaker.\n\nThe completed redesign maximises the performance potential of the Harbeth exclusive 115mm RADIAL2™ Cone Technology.

Perfectly attuned to each other, they allow music to be played back in outstanding quality. So that all components can work without interference, just like sensitive measuring equipment they need to be kept free of vibrations and shocks as far as possible. Vibrations are caused in different ways and they can be transmitted by structure-borne and airborne noise. The absorbers provide a remedy here. The Excellence Gel Absorbers have a special gel mixture at their core that can take up, i.e. absorb, vibration energy. They decouple loudspeakers and devices from the surface on which they are standing. You could say that it is sufficient to decouple the loudspeakers. But, as described above, there is still air-borne noise that also acts on the surface on which the devices are standing. So it therefore makes sense to decouple all of the devices from the surfaces on which they are standing. The same applies to devices such as CD players or hard drives that produce mechanical vibrations themselves and need to be kept away from other components as far as this is possible. \n\t\n\tFEATURES:\n\t- 4x gel absorber\n\t- 4x plates made of stainless\n\t- 4x Felt Pads and adhesive pads\n\t- 1x User manual\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2114/1/ExcellenceGelAbsorber.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2114/2/008560.jpg","Image_URL_3":"","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2224","curve":"Inakustik Excellent Cable USB A to B High Speed / cable usb a to b","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2224/1/2521077_0e0ae527-a1f5-461d-a6c0-efcaec042229_1080_1080.jpg","curve2":"The Excellence USB cable is specially designed for streaming HD audio and video formats.

The current generates correspondingly strong magnetic fields. In addition, the cable inductance constitutes a frequency-dependent resistance to the (alternating) current.

HDMI® Licensing LLC has now developed its own certification – the “Approved HDMI® Associate Program”. This provides consumers with the required transparency and enables them to check the HDMI® conformity of a given product at a glance. All certified products are now labelled with the official “Approved HDMI® Associate” logo.

As a result, Dominion™ subwoofers are capable of peak-to-peak excursions well in excess of 2.5-inches (63 mm - d108), and 2.7 inches (68 mm – d110), without distress or audible distortion.\n\t\n\t\tDominion™ amplifiers utilize an advanced Class D design in order to extract the most from the long-excursion driver platform. This design features a tightly regulated switching power supply, allowing the amplifier to generate prodigious amounts of unclipped output voltages. These technologies ensure that the Dominion™ powered subwoofers remain in their comfort zone, which is well beyond the point where most small subwoofers run out of power or driver capability.\n\t\n\t\tWith a host of signal processing features included, Dominion™ powered subwoofers can be integrated into most systems with ease. Low-pass signals are precisely guided, thanks to the onboard crossover’s 24 dB/octave Linkwitz-Riley alignment. Phase and polarity controls are onboard to aid in achieving the optimal acoustic transition between the subwoofer(s) and main speakers.

Unlike typical steady-state modeling systems, DMA takes into account the dynamic shifts created by current flow and back EMF under real power conditions, with real program material. The payoff offered by DMA optimization is a driver that faithfully tracks its input signal, at all listening levels, leading to superior bass definition and dynamics.\n\t\n\t\tThe extreme mounting depth of the E-Sub driver is very deliberate. It permits wide gaps to exist between the three suspension elements (the rubber surround and the dual spiders), imparting exceptional mechanical stability over the driver's full excursion range. This further improves linearity, reduces distortion and enhances long-term reliability. In a stroke of engineering elegance, the E-Sub’s steel front mounting flange forms the entire front baffle of the finished product, while the driver’s back-plate is threaded and bolted to the rear wall of its enclosure for support.\n\t\n\t\tTo power these innovative drivers, we engineered a completely new switching amplifier with a regulated, switching power supply, making its chassis more compact, lightweight and efficient, while still delivering ample, clean power to fully exercise the E-Sub driver's performance envelope.\n\t\n\t\tConveniently controlled from the E-Sub cabinet’s top panel, the amplifier incorporates studio-grade signal processing to make adjustments a much more enjoyable experience than rear–mounted controls found on most powered subwoofers. An attractive cover hides and protects the controls during normal use.\n\t\n\t\tThe feature set has been designed to allow the use of E-Subs in a wide range of applications, from full home theater systems to dedicated two-channel music systems, to desktop audio workstations. Analog inputs are provided for unbalanced line-level signals or speaker level signals. Dedicated line outputs are included to make a bi-amped system arrangement with no additional hardware required. Useful in combating ground-related noise problems, a rear panel switch configures the line level inputs as grounded or isolated.\n\t\n\t\tThe E-Sub’s active crossover is a true two-way, 4th order Linkwitz-Riley design, with a low-pass filter feeding the subwoofer's amplifier and a high-pass filtered signal exiting its line outputs. When the on-board crossover is defeated, as is typical in a home theater installation, the line outputs deliver a pass-through, buffered signal identical to its line inputs, easily permitting multiple E-Subs to be interconnected in a ‘daisy-chain' arrangement. Switchable polarity and a fully variable phase control round out the signal processing section. All signal processing is performed in the analog domain, ensuring very low latency in critical applications.\n\t\n\t\tPrecision-built in JL Audio's U.S. factory, all E-Sub are individually performance-verified and tested to deliver years of listening enjoyment in your home audio or home theater system.\n\t\n\t\tFinish: Gloss Black\n\t\n\t\tGrille finish: Black fabric\n\t\n\t\tEnclosure Type Sealed\n\t\n\t\tEnclosure Finish Black Gloss\n\n\n\tFrequency Response (Anechoic) 22 - 118 Hz (±1.5dB)\n\t-3 dB at 21 Hz / 120 Hz\n\t-10 dB at 17 Hz / 153 Hz\n\tEffective Piston Area (Sd) 84.4 sq in / 0.0545 sq m\n\tEffective Displacement 235 cu in / 3.9 L\n\tAmplifier Power 1500 W RMS short-term\n\tPower Mode(s) Off, On or Automatic (Signal-Sensing)\n\tLight Modes N/A\n\tUnbalanced Inputs Stereo or Mono (two RCA jacks)\n\tBalanced Inputs N/A\n\tSpeaker/High-Level Inputs Stereo or Mono (removeable plug)\n\tInput Grounding Isolated or Grounded\n\tInput Modes N/A\n\tLevel Control Variable, from full mute to +15dB over reference gain\n\tFilter Mode(s) Low-Pass\n\tFilter Slope(s) 24 dB/octave\n\tFilter Frequency Range 25 Hz - 130 Hz\n\tFilter Defeat Function Yes\n\tPolarity 0 or 180 degrees\n\tPhase Variable, 0- 280 degrees, referenced to 80 Hz\n\tExtreme Low Frequency (E.L.F.)

KEF's signature innovation places the tweeter in the acoustic center of the midrange cone, bringing the acoustic ideal of a single point source closer than ever to realisation. The result is a more detailed, more accurate three-dimensional sound image, which is dispersed more evenly throughout the room than is possible with a conventional speaker. Uni-Q's ultra-wide dispersion is further enhanced by KEF's 'tangerine' waveguide over the tweeter dome.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUni-Q sound taken to the next level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe closed box midrange cabinet design reduces the load on the Uni-Q midrange cone, increasing clarity and detail while delivering cleaner, punchier bass.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith the addition of the Damped tweeter loading tube providing a gentle termination of sound produced from the back of the tweeter, lower treble performance is improved dramatically and a new low-distortion inductor on the crossover provides cleaner bass response.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRedesigned Bass Drivers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLow-frequency (LF) drivers now have a larger roll surround, along with a new spider suspension to produce cleaner bass at high volumes.

The species varies in color, but is usually a pale-golden hue highly contrasted with darker steakes of chocolate brown, grey, black, or even pink. Australian Wwalnut grain is moderately close and even, and sometime wavy, resulting in a wide variety of figure effects.\n\t\n\tDESIGNED AND MADE IN THE USA\n\tAs the only speaker in the world to be in continuous production for over 70 years, the Klipschorn has remained relatively unchanged since its inception. Remember great sound? We do, too. The Klipschorn enclosure is still made in the USA, by proud craftsmen in Hope, Arkansas. Just like Paul W.Klipsch intended\n\t\n\t\n\tFEATURES:\n\tCORNER-HORN SPEAKER\n\tAs the only loudspeaker in the world to be continuously produced for 70 years, the Klipschorn has truly stood the test of time. Its patented low-frequency horn boasts a unique design that utilizes the floor and walls of the listening room to complete the horn, increasing the low frequency extension and efficieny. The original corner-horn loudspeaker's folded low frequency enclosure offers the most efficient use of space possible. Simply put, this is a basic design that cannot be improved according to the laws of physics.\n\t\n\tLIMITED EDITION\n\tThe 70th anniversary Klipschorn is limited to a production run of only 70 pairs of speaker. Each speaker features a small plaque identifiying its numbered sequence in the series and was signed by craftsman.\n\t\n\tNEW NAMEPLATE\n\tEach pair of Klipschorn features a product namplate celebrating its legendary history as the only consumber loudspeaker continuosly produced for 70 years.\n\t\n\tNEW VINTAGE GRILLE\n\tA unique, silver luster grille cloth complements the beaufitiful Australian Walnut wood veneer.\n\t\n\tNEW LOW-FREQUENCY HORN\n\tThe rear low-frequency horn has been enchaned and os fully enclosed, offering more placement versatility in the listening room.\n\t\n\tBOOK-MATCHED WOOD VENEER\n\tKlipsch only uses book-matched wood veneers for the Heritage series. The veneer leaves are kept in order as they are delicately sliced from the timber and precisely arranged to provide image as the splice joint - like turning the pages of a book. This gives each speaker an aesthentically appealing consistent apprearance rhat is treasured more than any pther cut of wood veneer.\n\t\n\t\n\tMATCHED PAIRS\n\tEach pair of Heritage series loudspeakers are grain-matched, using wood veneer panels that come from the same timber.

Utilizing Tractrix geometry, the all new Heresy IV ports alloww for the most efficient, fastest air transfer in their class, which reduces port noise for punchier low frequencies. Klipsch Tractrix ports have cutom designed inner flares that help reduce air turbulence entering thr port. Less turnbulent air helps reduce port noise for cleaner, more powerful bass.\n\t\n\tBI-AMP INPUT PANEL AND BINDING POSTS\n\tThe Heresy's premium, aluminum input panel accommodates large, high-quality speaker cable. Strong, versatile and quality binding posts provide the capability for bi-wiring or bi-amping. The quality continues with Audioquest Type 4 with Star-Quad Geometry internal wiring featuring carbon-loaded insulation, nitrogen-injected PE and solid long-grain copper conductors ensuring the purest signal transfer from input cup to crossover network to drivers.\n\t\n\tHIGH EFFICIENCY\n\tNothing in the industry sounds as big or is as efficient as the Heresy, given its relatively compact size.

When paired with the Tractrix Horn-loaded LTS tweeter, it provides speaker efficiency highest in its class. SLIM DESIGN Compliments todays flat panel TVs with an unobtrusive low profile design.

Remember great sound? We do, too. The RF-7 III enclosure is made in the USA, by proud craftsmen in Hope, Arkansas. Just like Paul W. Klipsch (PWK) intended. NEW 1 3 /4 TITANIUM DIAPHRAGM COMPRESSION DRIVER The compression driver features a new phase plug design to improve phase coherency at the throat of the horn, resulting in improved sound pressure linearity at high frequencies. 90° x 90° TRACTRIX® HORN The redesigned Tractrix Horn utilizes a circular horn throat paired to a square horn mouth to further improve high-frequency response and extension, while enhancing imaging and dynamics. The compressed molded rubber construction adds high frequency damping to reduce harshness and improve detail. This creates the cleanest, most natural sound possible. SPUN COPPER CERAMETALLIC WOOFERS™ Cerametallic woofers represent the pinnacle of Klipsch driver design, maintaining exceptional rigidity, and lightweight construction, for minimal cone breakup and distortion. When paired with the Tractrix horn-loaded compression driver, it provides speaker efficiency highest in its class. NEW TRACTRIX® PORT Utilizing Tractrix geometry, the new RF-7 III ports allow for the most efficient air transfer from the cabinet — for the cleanest, most powerful low frequency response on the market. DUAL CHAMBERED ENCLOSURE DESIGN The new bifurcated enclosure allows each 10” driver and port to work independently from the other. This improves the linearity of both drive systems, and minimizes standing wave problems inside the cabinet that can cause frequency anomalies in the sensitive midrange frequencies. CAST FRAME WOOFER DESIGN Each 10” woofer feature a heavy-duty cast aluminum frame for resonant-free operation.

A calibrated sub-enclosure provides an optimized environment for the midrange driver to operate within and without any interaction from the back wave pressure of the bass drivers. The black brushed aluminum enclosure is lustrous and stands firmly on a 4-point spiked outrigger base which provides perfect coupling to the floor for enhanced dynamic range.\n\t\n\tExtended high frequencies are provided by a newly designed Magico pure beryllium-diaphragm with an optimized 28-mm dome surface that is based on the fundamental design platform of the M-Project tweeter. A customized neodymium motor system is encased in an improved back chamber with new damping materials which provide ultra-low distortion, higher power handling, massive dynamic capabilities and extended linear voice coil movement.\n\tA newly designed Magico 6-inch midrange driver sets a new benchmark of measured performance in both frequency bandwidth and time domains. The cone material is formulated using Multi-Wall carbon fiber and a layer of XG Nanographene, which provides optimal stiffness to weight ratio with ideal damping properties.

While the CD6006 now boasts specially selected components and a reworked circuit layout, the PM6006 gains an optical digital input and a beefier design better suited to driving a wider range of loudspeakers.

The impedance at the Current Feedback point is limited, generating a very low phase shift. Marantz Current Feedback amplifiers reduce the need for phase compensation by minimizing Negative Feedback (NFB). This simplifies the signal path and results in a high through-rate, excellent transient response and superb sonic transparency across the full bandwidth. Unlike conventional Voltage Feedback topology, Current Feedback also makes the power amplifier insensitive to difficult loudspeaker loads.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMarantz HDAM Technology\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMarantz developed its own discrete circuit boards called Hyper-Dynamic Amplifier Modules, or HDAMs, to replace the chip based amps used elsewhere. Using discrete surface mount components with short mirror-image left and right signal paths, HDAMs outperform the regular integrated Op-amps dramatically in Slew Rate and noise level. The result is much more dynamic, accurate and detailed sound. Over the years, Marantz has developed different HDAMs to fit the particular requirements of players and amplifiers. The PM8006 uses the high-grade SA3 version.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMarantz Musical Phono EQ\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor a long time, Marantz integrated amplifiers have featured high-quality phono stages. We’ve elevated our commitment to vinyl with the Marantz Musical Phono EQ stage, as seen in the PM8006 amplifier. Enjoy the very best playback of all music sources, be they digital or analog. Marantz Musical Phono EQ uses two-stage amplification, allowing less gain per stage for lower distortion. The PM8006 combines Marantz HDAM technology with JFETs (junction gate field-effect transistors) in the input stage, providing high input impedance that eliminates the need for AC coupling capacitors and simplifies the signal path, vastly improving the signal purity overall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMarantz rethought the re-equalization process within the phono stage, splitting it into passive and active sections for more accurate equalization. The RIAA correction is carried out within an HDAM, while amplification is in the hands of a high-quality op-amp that runs in Class A mode for minimal distortion and clean, open sound. With Marantz Musical Phono EQ there’s no need to consider upgrading the PM8006 with offboard phono stage — the amplifier already includes premium-class phono capability for optimized playback of all formats.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToroidal Transformer\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA Toroidal transformer offers several advantages that derive from its efficiency and power capability. The shape of it lends to low levels of electromagnetic radiation and mechanical vibration, producing improved sound quality over what you might experience with dated transformer models.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOften Under Estimated: High Quality Volume Control\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNewly developed electric volume control uses the latest volume control IC to realize better channel separation and dynamic range and distortion-reduction, while retaining the operational feel of an analog volume control device.

PM-KI Ruby is built on a vibration-resistant double layer chassis with thick aluminum panes for rigidity and features a laser-engraved Ken Ishiwata signature to commemorate his legacy.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tKey Features\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEngineered and extensively tuned legendary Marantz sound master Ken Ishiwata and his team, drawing on more than 65 years of Marantz amplifier design knowledge\n\t\n\t\tMarantz high-resolution preamplifier stage with proprietary HDAM technology\n\t\n\t\tSwitching power amplifier design derived from flagship PM-10 amplifier\n\t\n\t\tGenerous output: 100W + 100W (into 8ohm), 200W + 200W (4ohm)\n\t\n\t\tFully-discrete, two-stage design for signal purity, with separate power supplies for preamp and power amplifier sections to reduce interference\n\t\n\t\tToroidal transformer dedicated to preamp for clarity and powerful sound\n\t\n\t\tCurrent feedback design with newly-developed wide-range circuitry\n\t\n\t\tHDAM® SA3 circuitry for clean signal and optimal dynamics\n\t\n\t\tMM/MC Phono input with new discrete Marantz Musical Premium Phono EQ circuit\n\t\n\t\tThick nickel-plated copper independent input terminals for CD and Phono, plus Marantz-original high-quality/high-purity copper-plated speaker terminals\n\t\n\t\tLinear volume control with new electric volume system\n\t\n\t\tHigh-quality construction with double-layer chassis, 5mm thick aluminum top lid, solid aluminum front and copper-plated chassis\n\t\n\t\tHigh-grade, carefully selected audio parts: ultra-low leak current Schottky diodes, low noise complementary transistors, high-grade resistors, newly developed custom electrolytic capacitors, audio grade film capacitors and mica capacitors.\n\t\n\t\tLaser-engraved Ken Ishiwata signature and Ruby motif, marking Ishiwata’s 40-year Marantz legacy\n\n\n\t \n\n\tExtensive Sound Tuning\n\n\n\tLed by Ken Ishiwata’s extensive, meticulous approach to tuning, the larger Marantz engineering team applied more than 65 years of experience and HiFi knowledge to create PM-KI Ruby, resulting in a final product that is a testament to Ken Ishiwata and the Marantz legacy.\n\n\t\n\t \n\n\tMarantz HDAM Technology\n\n\n\tMarantz developed its own discrete circuit boards called Hyper-Dynamic Amplifier Modules, or HDAMs, to replace the chip-based amps used elsewhere. Using discrete surface mount components with short mirror-image left and right signal paths, HDAMs outperform the regular integrated Op-amps dramatically in Slew Rate and noise level. The result is much more dynamic, accurate and detailed sound. Over the years, Marantz has developed different HDAMs to fit the particular requirements of players and amplifiers. The PM-KI Ruby uses the latest high-grade SA3 version. Combined with optimized circuit design layout and carefully selected components, the PM-KI Ruby provides exceptional sound quality and performance.\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMarantz Musical Premium Phono EQ\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesigned to deliver optimal sound quality by simplifying the signal path, the Marantz Musical Premium Phono EQ stage in the PM-KI-Ruby amplifier can be used with both moving magnet and low-output moving coil cartridges, thanks to a built-in MC head amplifier. Distortion is reduced by using two-stage amplification in the phono stage, and Marantz HDAMs are combined with JFETs (junction gate field effect transistors) in the input stage, giving high input impedance. The exclusion of coupling capacitors further simplifies the design, reducing signal distortion and enhances signal purity.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHigh Quality Volume Control\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNewly developed electric volume control uses the latest volume control IC to realize better channel separation, dynamic range and distortion-reduction, while retaining the operational feel of an analog volume control device. The amplifier employs new Marantz-designed electric volume control for high linearity and best-in-class channel separation.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Feedback Amplifier\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCurrent Feedback amplification is a well-known, Marantz-original circuit technology, thoughtfully designed to match the requirements of Super Audio hi-res music for wide-bandwidth, high-speed reproduction. The impedance at the Current Feedback point is limited, generating a very low phase shift. Marantz Current Feedback amplifiers reduce the need for phase compensation by minimizing Negative Feedback (NFB). This simplifies the signal path and results in a high through-rate, excellent transient response and superb sonic transparency across the full bandwidth. Unlike conventional Voltage Feedback topology, Current Feedback also makes the power amplifier insensitive to difficult loudspeaker loads.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBalanced Power Amplification\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDrawing on design elements of the PM-10, the PM-KI Ruby is built to leverage enhancements, maintain the purest possible sound and support the power needed to drive the most demanding speakers. The amplifier output stage of the PM-KI Ruby allows a large power output, delivering 2x100W into an 8ohm load, and easily copes with high-impedance speakers thanks to a 2x200W output into 4ohms. The amplifier module connects directly to the rear panel PCB on the PM-KI Ruby to maintain signal purity and sound stability.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPure Analog Design\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe purely analog design of the PM-KI Ruby contributes to its noise-reduction structure and clean build. Rather than build the DAC into the amplifier, which would add noise within the chassis, Marantz built the PM-KI Ruby without one and then implemented the DAC in the SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD Player. This eliminated interference with the delicate analog signals passing through the amp, maintaining an analog environment that’s as pure and clean as possible.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCarefully Selected Components\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMarantz has a steadfast reputation for choosing the best-possible components for its Premium Series products. The Marantz alternative to the “amplifier on a chip” IC components, the HDAM, is a miniature amplifier module built entirely of discrete components. Marantz engineers selected and optimized the HDAM through extensive listening in dedicated Marantz facilities in Europe and Japan. Extensive, painstaking and meticulous tuning has long been the secret of exquisite-sounding Marantz amplifiers. During the development stage, every part is carefully selected, tested and validated by Marantz audio engineers to ensure audio perfection every time you listen.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMultiple Analog Inputs and Outputs\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn addition to phono and CD analog inputs, the PM-KI Ruby features two line-level inputs and two pairs of recorder input/output jacks that enable the connection of multiple sources and recorders. Use the PM-KI Ruby as a standalone stereo power amplifier for additional system configuration versatility with the included power amp input, or connect the PM-KI Ruby to an external power amplifier via the stereo pre-amp outputs.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDedicated Headphone Output\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUsing Marantz-proprietary HDAM discrete modules, the headphone circuit delivers superb audio fidelity with the widest range of headphone types and impedances, including low impedance headphones.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSystem Remote Control\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUse the elegant remote control to operate the PM-KI Ruby as well as the complementary SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD Player.

A front panel constructed from thick, heavy, non-magnetic aluminum panels and an 5mm dense aluminum top cover eliminate added interference. Nickel-plated copper independent input terminals for CD and Phono plus Marantz-original high-quality/high-purity copper-plated speaker terminals ensure the best signal possible.\n\n\t\n\n\tMore Than 60 Years of Audiophile Heritage\n\n\n\tFounded in 1953, Marantz has a long and rich history of designing audio components embraced by music lovers and critical listeners around the world. Because Music Matters, the PM-KI Ruby carries on our long tradition of delivering a best-in-class listening experience for music and cinema.\n\t\n\t\n\tSPECIFICATIONS

Much more. Because now you can connect this superb integrated amplifier directly to a vast range of digital sources and use its superior DAC to create an unbelievably high level of audio enjoyment with new media.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOf course, we have retained the pre-amp and power-amp sections that exclusively feature discrete components – not a single IC in sight of the signal path. That's because specially selected single components not only outperform ICs in quality, they also make it possible to refine the sound in much more detail, resulting in more clarity and transparency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd of course we have retained the lower impedance shielded Toroidal transformer, as well as the customized main capacitors. And of course all of the original features - such as five-line audio input including phono, two-pairs of gold-plated speaker connections with the convenience of bi-wiring, and a remote handset - are all still there. But now, the unit includes optical and coaxial digital inputs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe DAC is the 192kHz/24bit high current CS4398, which is already proven in many Premium Range products. And the complete digital section is fully shielded by an extra metal housing to ensure that the digital stage has no effect on the analogue signal. In short, the new PM6005 is your proven and excellent bridge to the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMain Features\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntegrated Current Feedback Amplifier with 2x 45W / 8 ohm rms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital input (opt. / coax.) to extend connectivity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest audio from digital input signal by high quality DAC CS4398 and Marantz HDAM SA2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFully shielded DAC unit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGold Plated Inputs/Outputs incl.

This latest iteration of amplifier and CD player sees both components share a tried-and-tested 192kHz/24-bit DAC, upstream from its custom HDAM audio stages, as used across the Marantz range. While the CD6006 now boasts specially selected components and a reworked circuit layout, the PM6006 gains an optical digital input and a beefier design better suited to driving a wider range of loudspeakers. If you’re seeking the high-end Marantz sound at a bargain price, this combination’s supremely polished, yet powerful performance won’t

The result is even finer, more delicate audio detail. But even before these new refinements, this player was already standards-setter of repute because it utilises many of the advanced technologies that were originally developed for the Reference Series SA-7S1. For example, it uses the exclusive-to-Marantz Dynamic Digital Filtering technology, which makes standard CDs sound as incredible as SACDs. It offers two filters for different tastes, not just for discs, but for any digital signal. What’s more, it uses a high-end algorithm previously used only in professional recording studios. This type of filtering retains greater detail for an even wider sound stage and a perfect balance. In addition, it provides fully balanced signal handling on short, symmetrical, and discrete circuit architecture as well as the HDAM®SA2 high-speed amplifier module. The internal high-precision clock minimises jitter to the lowest possible level, while the rigid double-layer chassis dampens vibration to an absolute minimum. There is also extensive copper-plating and system-block shielding to keep the signal as clean as possible. You also get a high-quality headphone output featuring HDAM®SA2 and current feedback amplification. In addition, we have included a USB input on the front panel for playback and recharging. The DAC mode offers three digital inputs – the USB-B works in asynchronous mode when directly connected to the PC, plus coaxial and optical digital input. All of which means, you get more detail, more precision and more emotion than ever – and all in a wideopen sound stage that positions every instrument and vocalist with pin-point precision.

Complete with thoughtful engineering, painstaking tuning and extensive listening sessions, SA-KI Ruby achieves the elevated output worthy of its name. Elegantly features Ishiwata’s laser-engraved signature to commemorate the design and heightened listening experience that honors the decades-long partnership between him and Marantz.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tA History of Excellence\n\n\n\tA pioneer of CD playback and musical integrity, the first Marantz CD player — the CD-63 — premiered in 1982 and set the stage for further development and mastery of CD media players. Ken Ishiwata helped sculpt Marantz media players into the world-class, masterful technology that is synonymous with Marantz today. From his passion, the Limited Edition, Special Edition and later Ken Ishiwata Signature models were born — all designed to further optimize and elevate the exceptional CD performance of Marantz media players. That passion furthers the Marantz legacy of musical excellence with the SA-KI Ruby.\n\n\t\n\t \n\n\tTransport Mechanism\n\n\n\tAt the heart of the SA-KI Ruby is an innovative new SACDM-3 transport mechanism, engineered solely for the best possible performance when playing SA-CDs, CDs and music stored on data discs. This new mechanism promises exceptional sound quality from conventional CD and SA-CD discs and allows listeners to create their own high-resolution audio compilation discs using a computer DVD burner. The SA-KI Ruby supports FLAC files from 44.1kHz to 192kHz at up to 24-bit resolution, DSD2.8MHz and DSD 5.6MHz, ALAC (Apple Lossless), AIFF and MP3 files. Creating and playing hi-res disc compilations is as simple as it is enjoyable.\n\n\t\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCDs, SA-CDs and Beyond\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe SA-KI Ruby is a fully functional digital-to-analog converter for music stored on a home computer and features Optical and Coaxial digital inputs for existing source components. These inputs support files up to 192kHz/24bit and contain a USB-B asynchronous input for direct connection with a computer. The USB-B input is compatible with PCM and DXD music files at up to 384kHz/32bit, as well as DSD2.8MHz, DSD5.6MHz and DSD11.2MHz.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore Than a DAC\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBuilt with an integrated DAC, the SA-KI Ruby features an all-new disc transport mechanism that re-engineers the digital to analog conversion. Taking full advantage of the 1-bit conversion technology, the SA-KI RUBY incorporates innovative new filtering and up-conversion, providing a simple yet elegant solution.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tMarantz Musical Mastering: MMM-Stream and MMM-Conversion\n\n\n\tAt the heart of digital audio in the SA-KI Ruby lies DSD. PCM and DXD inputs are up-converted to DSD at 11.2MHz using the proprietary MMM-Stream converter within the player, and the high-frequency signal produced is processed by the unique MMM-Conversion stage, used in place of a conventional DAC, to produce the analog output. The MMM-Stream section of the process replaces the oversampling filters normally used in digital to analog conversion and allows the implementation of the Marantz Musical Mastering filtering. Two system clocks ensure the most accurate up-conversion of the incoming signal, whether it’s from the disc or digital inputs, ranging from 44.1kHz to 12.288MHz. Sigma Delta Modulation allows a pure DSD-standard signal to be passed to the conversion section in the form of a very high-frequency stream of pulses. The design of the DSD-to-analog filter feeds into the familiar Marantz HDAM (Hyper Dynamic Amplifier Modules) in the output stage for optimal sound quality.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHigh Current Power Supply\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe power supply of the SA-KI Ruby features a large high current toroidal power transformer with OFC (oxygen-free copper) secondary wires, along with high speed, high current Schottky Barrier Diodes in the rectifier stage for the purest DC voltage output.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSystem Remote Control\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe elegant remote control features an intuitive ergonomic layout and is equipped with amplifier control functions to operate both the SA-KI Ruby and the complementary PM-KI Ruby reference class integrated stereo amplifier. Use the integrated remote control input and output jacks to connect the SA-KI Ruby to other compatible Marantz components. An internal/external switch on the rear panel provides additional system control flexibility.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPure Analog Design\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe purely analog design of the PM-KI Ruby contributes to its noise-reduction structure and clean build. Rather than build the DAC into the amplifier, which would add noise within the chassis, Marantz built the PM-KI Ruby without one and then implemented the DAC in the SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD Player. This eliminated interference with the delicate analog signals passing through the amp, maintaining an analog environment that’s as pure and clean as possible.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLow Noise Fluorescent Display\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe deluxe low noise LC display features clear, easy to read alpha-numeric characters and is compatible with CD Text encoded music discs. Display can be turned off via the display control button on the remote. For enhanced user experience, bit depth of the input signal is now available on the front display of the SA-KI Ruby.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDedicated Headphone Output\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConnect your favorite headphones directly to the SA-KI Ruby via the convenient front panel headphone jack, which also features its own selectable gain control. The headphone circuit is compatible with the widest range of headphone types and lower impedance headphones. The diameter of the volume knob was increased by 35% over the previous SA-14S1 for easier control and fine tune adjustments.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tBuilt to Perform\n\n\n\tLike the complementary PM-KI Ruby integrated amplifier, the SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD player is constructed to the highest standards, with a copper-plated double layer chassis for rejection of mechanical interference, a front panel built from thick, heavy, non-magnetic aluminum panels and a 5mm thick aluminum top cover. Single layer, nickel-plated matching copper RCA terminals in the SA-KI Ruby outperform the terminals of competitors and offer an exemplary listening experience.\n\n\t\n\n\tMore Than 60 Years of Audiophile Heritage\n\n\n\tFounded in 1953, Marantz has a long and rich history of designing audio components embraced by music lovers and critical listeners around the world. Because Music Matters, the SA-KI Ruby carries the tradition of delivering a best-in-class listening experience for music and cinema.\n\t\n\t\n\tSPECIFICATIONS\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCD

Following the digital audio precendent set in our current solid state intergated amplfiers, the C53 stereo preamplifier features and upgradeable digital audio module. But unlike our integrated amplifiers that use our DA1 Digital Audio Module, the C53 is the first to use our new, more advance DA2 Digital Audio Module.\n\t\n\tThe DA2 builds upon the DA1 with an expanded set of capabilities. In addition to having all the same connections as the DA1 (2 coaxial, 2 optical, 1 USB and 1 proprietary MCT for use with our MCT series of SACD/CD Transports), a new audio-only HDMI Audio Return Channel (ARC)1 connection is included on the DA2. This allows it to be connected to TVs with a compatible HDMI (ARC) output to bring your TV sound to a new level of audio performance by listening to it through your home stereo system. Popular multi-channel audio formats from Dolby® and DTS® are supported and will be expertly converted to 2-channel audio for proper playback through the C53. When CEC communication is enabled in both the C53 and your TV, your TV remote can control the power and volume of the C53.\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAdditionally, the DA2’s USB input can support native playback of up to DSD512, surpassing the DSD256 limit of the DA1. This increased DSD playback support is thanks to the next generation, Quad Balanced, 8-channel, 32-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) that powers the DA2. This audiophile-grade DAC is highlighted by both an improved dynamic range and total harmonic distortion compared to the DA1. The USB input also supports DXD up to 384kHz. The coax and optical inputs can decode digital music up to 24-bit/192kHz for high resolution audio playback. Rounding out the DA2 is an MCT input that offers a secure, custom DSD connection for playback of the high definition audio found on SACDs when paired with our MCT series of SACD/CD Transports to produce the best possible sound quality from your SACD collection.\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIn addition to the 7 digital inputs found in the DA2 module, the C53 also has 9 analog inputs, giving it a nearly inexhaustible number of 16 total inputs for connecting all your music sources. The analog inputs consist of 3 balanced and 4 unbalanced connections, plus 1 Moving Coil and 1 Moving Magnet phono inputs for plugging in your trusted turntable. Outputs include 3 variable balanced and unbalanced connections along with 1 fixed unbalanced connection.\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTone controls include an 8-band analog equalizer; each band can be adjusted ± 12dB so you can fine tune your music just the way you like. Our High Drive Headphone Amplifier can power virtually any pair of headphones, while Headphone Crossfeed Director (HXD®) can bring an added dimension to your music. Home Theater Pass Through lets the C53 be seamlessly integrated into your home theater system. Power Control ports let you easily turn other connected McIntosh components on and off, while the Data Ports can send remote control commands to connected source components.\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe C53 is one of many McIntosh products to receive Roon Tested designation from Roon Labs. It has been profiled and tested by both Roon and McIntosh for maximum compatibility. Roon will recognize it and send it audio optimized for its capabilities. No fiddling with checkboxes or dropdowns, Roon Tested devices are automatically identified and configured out of the box for a superior customer experience.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAll this audio technology is packaged inside the C53’s classic McIntosh design featuring a black glass front panel backlit by direct LED lighting, blue meters, rotary knobs, an illuminated logo and aluminum end caps. An attractive polished stainless steel chassis finishes the distinguished look. It can be paired with an assortment of amplifiers, CD players, turntables, tuners, media streamers, room correction devices and speakers to complete your home audio system.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSPECIFICATIONS:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNumber of

And thanks to our patented Unity Coupled Circuit output transformer, this full 300 Watts is available to 2, 4 or 8 Ohm speakers.\n\nThe MC2301 is the first McIntosh vacuum tube amplifier to use our Quad Balanced design. This design cancels virtually all noise and distortion in the audio signal. As a result, even when amplified to high levels the signal is effectively free of any distortion. Our fuse-less short-circuit protection circuit Sentry Monitor™ disengages the output stage before current exceeds safe operating levels and then resets automatically. Inputs for balanced and unbalanced cables are available to provide flexibility in connecting the rest of your audio system.","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 201.405.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2019","Title":"McIntosh MC2301 Vacuum Tube Amplifier","Text":"\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2019/1/MC2301REVISI.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2019/2/MC2301FrontTop.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2019/3/MC2301Back.jpg","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2299","curve":"McIntosh MC275 MC 275 Pre Power Amplifier 2ch","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2299/1/MC275AC.jpg","curve2":"This tube power amplifier has all the features to meet the needs of today’s music enthusiast, while preserving the qualities that have made the MC275 the most revered McIntosh tube amplifier.\n\nThis sixth generation MC275 has many subtle enhancements from the previous release that greatly improve performance.

To enjoy your CDs, it can be paired with any product that has standard digital inputs and a digital-to-analog convertor (DAC). This includes select McIntosh home theater processors, integrated amplifiers and preamplifiers.\n\nFor SACD playback, the MCT500’s proprietary MCT output needs to be connected (via the included cable) to a McIntosh product with an MCT input. This includes the D1100, C53, C2700, C49 and D150 preamplifiers, MA9000, MA8900, MA7200 or MA5300 integrated amplifiers or MAC7200 receiver. When the MCT500 is connected to one of these devices, a secure digital connection is created, allowing for the playback of the high definition audio found on SACDs. Regular CDs can also be played over the MCT connection.\n\nAll common disc types can be played on the MCT500, including SACD, CD, CD-R/RW and DVD-R. A twin laser optical pickup assures optimal disc reading. A USB input is conveniently located on the front panel for easy access. In addition to store bought CDs and SACDs, popular file formats such as AAC, AIFF, ALAC, DSD (up to DSD128), FLAC, MP3, WAV (up to 24-bit/192kHz) and WMA can be played from user generated CD or DVD Data Discs and USB flash drives.1","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 80.620.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2017","Title":"McIntosh MCT500 SACD/CD Player","Text":"\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2017/1/MCT500.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2017/2/MCT500FrontTopbackground.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2017/3/MCT500FrontTop.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2017/4/MCT500Angle.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2215","curve":"McIntosh MT2 Precision Turntable / mcintosh mt2 turntable","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2215/1/mt2.jpg","curve2":"The McIntosh MT2 Precision Turntable combines the latest in turntable technology and design to deliver both superb performance and accurate playback.

Truly a one-of-a-kind product, it is designed for those who want maximum flexibility in their home audio system but don’t want – or don’t have the space for – a large audio system in their home. With all the built-in connectivity the MTI100 offers, it can become the center piece of a modern home audio system for modern lifestyles. Simply add your favorite speakers of choice (such as our XR50 bookshelf or XR100 floorstanding speakers) and you’ll have a complete and comprehensive audio system.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBesides the turntable that plays both 33-1/3 and 45 rpm vinyl records, the MTI100 also includes a power amplifier, a vacuum tube preamplifier section, a shielded phono preamplifier, an unbalanced auxiliary input, digital audio coaxial and optical inputs, a Bluetooth receiver, a subwoofer output, stereo speaker outputs for sharing your music with friends, and a headphone jack for personal listening.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\"There is no audible noise in any section of the MTI100. Phono and digital sections are free of playback artifacts, even with highly sensitive speakers... a piece of sonic artistry, that provides high-end sound from all the sources you can imagine, and looks great doing it... The level of quality, functionality, and audio performance makes it the perfect purchase for anyone wanting a high quality, all-inclusive music system.\" Named The Audiophile Apartment’s Product of the Year 2019. - The Audiophile Apartment\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe 7 pound (3.18 kg) machined aluminum platter resides on the top of the unit. This and the matching machined aluminum tonearm with anti-skate sit atop a 3/8” (9.5mm) thick piece of glass – the same glass found in the front panels of our larger amplifiers; this in turn sits atop a custom 1/4” (6.35mm) thick metal plate that adds stability. The combined heftiness of both the platter and metal plate helps resist and absorb noise that could be caused by external vibrations.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe MTI100 \"oozes class and luxury...\" no other product Brockhouse has reviewed \"elicited more oohs and ahs than the MTI100...\" its \"big, spacious sound\" made \"listening to music an event.\" - SoundStage\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe belt drive platter with manual speed change is driven by an industrial grade permanent magnet AC synchronous motor with a 2 speed pulley. With this motor, the platter speed is precisely synced to the AC power line’s frequency to deliver precise rotational speeds for playback accuracy. The MTI100 comes with a Sumiko Olympia Moving Magnet cartridge, whose upgraded stylus and cantilever assembly allow for more dynamic punch and improved frequency response.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\"For an all-in-one device, the MTI100 rocks!\" With all its connectivity options, \"it can comfortably function as the heart of a more extensive system... sure to appeal to today’s millennials who have a vinyl collection and high expectations for sound quality, as well as to audiophiles who may be down/right-sizing or looking for a simple second system with minimal compromise.\" - SoundStage Australia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tA Class D amplifier that’s rated for 80 Watts per channel into 4 Ohms or 50 Watts per channel into 8 Ohms is used to drive a pair of speakers (sold separately) that are connected via the back panel speaker binding posts. Two 12AX7 vacuum tubes power the main preamplifier section, while a separate dedicated phono preamplifier is housed in a custom shielding box that prevents interference or noise from seeping into the vinyl signal. Together, the vacuum tube preamplifier and shielded phono preamplifier are a perfect choice to help make your vinyl albums sound their best.\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTo combine playing vintage vinyl records with modern playback methods, you can also stream music to the MTI100 via its High Definition Bluetooth 4.2 input that ensures you receive the best sound quality possible from your Bluetooth device. An external Bluetooth antenna helps achieve optimal reception and signal quality. The analog and digital audio inputs allow external sources, such as a TV, tuner or CD Player, to be connected. Not to overlook the impact that low sound frequencies can add, a subwoofer output is also included. Finally, for personal listening, the front panel includes a headphone jack that is powered by our High Drive headphone amplifier, which features increased gain and output power and is optimized for virtually all headphone types.\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\n\t\n\t\tPower, volume and input selection can be controlled by either the included remote or via two knobs on the unit. An illuminated McIntosh logo is located in the top glass panel, while a classic McIntosh-styled die cast aluminum name badge adorns the front of the chassis.

In addition, a subwoofer output is included to connect an external powered subwoofer to further enhance low frequencies. As the RS200 can be placed in a variety of locations with unique sonic characteristics, a 3-position EQ switch allows you to set the EQ based on your room and listening preferences.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe RS200 comes loaded with several streaming options. It features Apple® AirPlay® 2; Bluetooth® 5.0 with support for AAC, Qualcomm® aptX™ HD for hi res playback and Qualcomm aptX Low Latency for improved audio transmission speed to deliver sound in sync with visual media; DTS Play-Fi® whole-home wireless audio; and DLNA support.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFor non-streaming applications, it has an audio-only HDMI ARC1 input that connects only to TVs that have Audio Return Channel (ARC) capabilities; an optical input to connect TVs without ARC, or digital sources such as CD Players; a USB Type-B input to play music from your Macintosh or Windows computer; and a 3.5mm AUX input for connecting various analog music sources.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Sound quality!

Hell, don't just look at it. Stare at it for a while and listen to it with deep intent.

With the amazing 4K video today’s TVs can produce, it’s time the sound matched the picture quality. For enveloping home theater sound, connect a pair of our Play-Fi compatible RS100 Wireless Speakers (sold separately) to use as surround speakers.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAirPlay 2 is an Apple technology designed to control home audio systems and speakers in any room – with a tap or by just asking Siri – right from an iPhone®, iPad®, HomePod™, or Apple TV®. It offers multiroom audio, Siri voice control, and enhanced playback. The RS200 is an Amazon Works With Alexa certified product. Simply speak to your Alexa control device to operate your RS200 from any room.2 You can designate the RS200 as your Alexa Preferred Speaker in the Alexa app, then you’ll no longer need to specify the RS200 by name in order for music to play on it. Voice commands as simple as “Alexa, play top-40” to a linked control device will initiate playback on the RS200. The RS200 does not contain any listening capabilities and relies entirely on an Alexa control device for voice control. (How do I setup Alexa?)\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPlay-Fi from DTS has built-in interfaces for many leading streaming services including Amazon Prime Music, Pandora®, Qobuz, SiriusXM®, Spotify® and TIDAL to name just a few (list subject to change).3 You can save up to four of your favorite Play-Fi streaming services via the preset buttons on the top of the RS200; once configured, you can quickly play the saved streaming services directly from the cloud without needing a mobile device by simply tapping the preset buttons. You can also stream audio from wired devices connected to the RS200 to other Play-Fi devices on your network (such as the RS100 Wireless Speaker) via Play-Fi Line In Broadcasting. And Play-Fi’s Critical Listening mode allows you to send your high resolution audio files to the RS200 with no transcoding or downsampling.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWith its space saving design and room filling sound, the RS200 is versatile enough to accommodate the audio needs of any room in your home. While designed for modern streaming, it features classic McIntosh design elements such as a black glass front panel, illuminated logo, control knobs, and a pair of fast responding blue Watt meters. A free app is available for Apple devices to check and update the RS200's firmware (an Android version will be available soon). Contact your local dealer to learn more.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1) The HDMI ARC input will only play audio from a compatible TV. It will not pass video to or from a TV, or play audio from any non-TV source.\n\t\t\t\t2) Requires use of a third party Alexa Built-in Product (sold separately). The RS200 and Alexa Built-In Product must be on the same network.\n\t\t\t\t3) All services may not be available in all regions; certain services may not yet be enabled for all apps; subscriptions may be required.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe RS200 is compatible with AirPlay 2. iOS 11.4 or later is required.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTo wirelessly stream music to the RS200 via Apple AirPlay 2 or Play-Fi, a wireless router is required.

The Z20 DAC employs double isolation to ensure a clean audio signal from its USB input. First an asynchronous USB receiver is employed which re-times the audio data according to one of the two low-jitter master clocks (one for 44.1/88.2/176.4 kHz and one for 48/96/192 kHz). After that comes an Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter which up-samples all incoming audio streams (USB, coaxial and optical) to 192kHz/24bit. This further reduces clock jitter and produces a constant high speed data stream for the DAC chip itself.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\tThe Z20 uses the same Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC chip as Myryad’s high-end MXC7000 CD player. The CS4398 is a fifth order delta-sigma converter which delivers wide dynamic range, low noise and low distortion. It actually contains four separate DACs – with push-pull outputs for each of the stereo channels. Each output feeds a differential-input low-pass analogue filter using a high-speed low-distortion FET input op-amp, close-tolerance metal film resistors and precision polypropylene film/foil capacitors. This arrangement suppresses ground-related noise from the DAC and delivers the cleanest possible audio output. To ensure no degradation of this pristine audio signal there is no coupling capacitor in the signal path to the output jacks. Instead a second high-speed low-distortion FET input op-amp is used to provide a “DC servo” to eliminate DC on the line outputs.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\tThe power supply employs a low-noise toroidal mains transformer with separate windings for analogue and digital circuitry. It is mounted inside a steel screening enclosure to reduce any magnetic interaction even further. The transformer is of a special low-idle-power design so the Z20 draws less than 0.5W of power in standby – without the need for a separate standby transformer.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\tA total of 10 separate power supply regulators are used in the Z20, each optimised for its own task. They ensure that high-speed digital processing devices are isolated from each other and that no noise from these circuits can affect the analogue audio side. There is a separate high-isolation power supply solely for the master crystal clocks to maintain the lowest possible jitter.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital input sources\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUSB (2.0), S/PDIF coaxial, S/PDIF optical\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital input word lengths supported\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t16 – 24 bits\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital input sampling frequencies supported\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, 192kHz\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital upsampling - asynchronous\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto 24bit 192kHz\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tD/A Converter\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCirrus CS4398 24bit DAC\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnalogue filter\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLow noise 3-pole dual differential\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrequency response (20Hz – 20kHz)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t±0.2dB\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTHD @ 1kHz 0dBFs, 24bit\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<0.001%\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSignal-to-Noise ratio (A weighted)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>112dB\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOutput level\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.4 Vrms\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOutput impedance\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t240Ω\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDimensions (w x h x d)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t205 x 56 x 228mm\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWeight (net)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.36kg\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinish\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNatural Silver fascia with Silver Grey casing or Satin Black fascia with Black Casing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"Rp 9.000.000,-","Discounted_Price":"Rp 3.500.000,-","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1766/1/myryad-z20-dac-black.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1766/2/z20-2.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1766/3/z20dac.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1766/4/232a396052c065aa98c55d65d54546ed_480.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2283","curve":"NAD 546BEE 546 bee CD Player","curve_URL1":"","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2283/1/NAD546BEE.jpg","curve2":"The C 546BEE lives up to its predecessor’s reputation, the C 545BEE, by delivering a performance that is both refined and riveting.

In fact an optional HDMI 4K switcher module is available now allowing the best sound from any of the many HDMI sources available. While the C658 immeditely replace your streamer, DAC, and Preamp, it also adds many new features you may not be awawre of, like a Bluetooth aptX HD transmitter to use with your wireless headphone.\n\t\n\tBluOS Enabled\n\tAlso on board is BluOS, the most sophisticated High Res streaming system available. BluOS natively supports over 15 streaming music services and indexing of over 250,000 tracks from local network sources. The C 658 becomes a node in the BluOS ecosystem allowing high res network streaming to 64 zones and control options for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS phones, tablets, and desk top devices. BluOS also supports all major smart home controllers and is available in a wide range of products making it easy to create a whole house audio system with the C 658 at its heart.\n\t\n\tTraditional NAD Performance and Value\n\tThe C 658 is part of our Classic Series of components which have an enviable reputation for giving Music Lovers more enjoyment for less money. If you want a solid block of hand–crafted aluminum with gold plated accents you’ll need to look elsewhere. If you want state-of-the-art performance and features in a sturdy no-nonsense package then you have the right address.\n\t\n\tHigh Resolution in Every Detail\n\tMost NAD components have been High Res for 45 years with very wide bandwidth, low distortion, and ultra-low noise. We just never had High Res source material to play. With High Res digital recording and streaming, combined with advanced technology like MQA, record companies are opening their vaults and releasing Studio Master Quality recordings. MQA decoding is available through BluOS Streaming content. The C 658 is pure High Res from input to output and features the ESS Sabre 32bit DAC , one of the best performing DACs on the market today with its 118dB Dynamic Range and incredibly low jitter spec. All preamp functions are executed in the digital domain including the same wide range non-truncating digital volume control used in our Masters Series components. This offers an incredibly short analog signal path that, rather uniquely, is identical for all volume settings. Sophisticated active power supplies provide super clean voltages to all circuits to keep noise and distortion at the edge of measurability.\n\t\n\tMake the Speakers Disappear (It's Not Magic)\n\tThe C658 is also the first NAD stereo component to a feature Dirac Live room correction, the most sophisticated and effective room correction available. Dirac corrects the impulse response of your speakers, in addition to the frequency response of your room, for a truly transparent window into the musical perormance. When the room resonances are tamed and the transient response is corrected, the result is magical. You have never heard your speakers sound this invisible or this good\n\t\n\tMaster Quality Authenticated\n\tMaster Quality Authenticated (MQA) is a revolutionary end to end technology built into every BlueOS Enabled amplifier to capture and deliver MQA music to your speakers in the purest quality. All BlueOS Enabled players and systems include a powerful decoder and audio rendere for the millions of the MQA encode songs, The MQA logo shown in the BlueOS app indicates that the unit is decoding ad playing an MQA stream or file, and lets you know that you are hearing exactly what the artist recorded and approved in the studio\n\t\n\tSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLINE INPUT, PRE-OUT\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTHD (20Hz - 20kHz)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<0.005% at 2V out\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSignal to Noise Ratio\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>106dB (IHF: A-weighted, ref. 500mV out, unity gain)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tChannel separation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>80dB (1kHz)\n\t\t\t\t70dB (10kHz)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Impedance (R and C)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t22k ohms + 100pF\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMaximum input signal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>4.5Vrms (ref.01% THD)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOutput Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSource Z + 240 Ohm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput sensitivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t93mV (ref. 500mV out, Volume maximum)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency response\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t+-0.3dB (20Hz - 20kHz)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMaximum voltage output - IHF load\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>4.5V (ref.0.1% THD)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTone Controls Treble\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>+-7.0dB at 20kHz; Bass:+-7.0dB at 60Hz;Balanced: -10dB\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPHONO INPUT, AUDIO PRE-OUT\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTHD (20Hz - 20kHz)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<0.01% at 2V out\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSignal to Noise Ratio\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>84dB (200 ohm source; A-weighted ref 500mV out)\n\t\t\t\t>76dB (MM cartridge source, IHF; A-weighted, ref.500mV out)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Sensitivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1.44mV (ref 500mV out, Volume maximum)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency Response\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>+-0.3dB (20Hz - 20kHz)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMaximum input signal at 1kHz\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>80mVrms (ref 0.1% THD)\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLINE INPUT, HEADPHONE OUT\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTHD (20Hz - 20kHz\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<0.0005% at 1V out\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSignal to Noise ratio\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>110dB (32 ohms loads;A-WTD, ref. 2V out, unity gain)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency Response\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t+-0.3dB (20Hz - 20kHz)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tChannel separation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>>60dB at 1kHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOutput impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t6 Ohms\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDAC\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSupported audio file formats\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMP3, AAC, WMA, OGG, WMA-L, ALAC, OPUS\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHigh Resolution audio formats\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMQA, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, Supports converted DSD\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNative sampling rates\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tup to 32bit/192kHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBit depths\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t16-24\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBLUOS\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSupported operating systems\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPlays music from network shares on the following desktop operating systems: Microsoft Windows XP, 2000, Vista, 7, 8 to current Windows Operating Systems and Mac OS X versions\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUser interface mobile operating system\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIuOS - Free Android and iOS App available online at Google Play and Apple App store\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFree internet radio\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSpotify, Amazon Music, TIDAL, Deezer, Qobuz, HDTracks, HighResAudio, Murfie, JUKE, Napster, Slacker Radio, KKBox, Bugs\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBluetooth Quality\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBluetooth aptX HD wireless built-in\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBluetooth connectivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTwo-Way (Transmit and Receive)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNetwork Connectivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGigabit Ethernet RJ45\n\t\t\t\tWiFi 5 (802.11 ac/n)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDimensions in mm and Weight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tW x H x D (435 x 100 x 405), 15kg\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2140/1/NAD658.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2140/2/nad_c658_1.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2140/3/NAD-C-658-DAC-Amplifier-large-Rear-.jpg","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2139","curve":"NAD M10 Integrated Amplifier / Streaming Amplifier","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2139/1/M10.jpg","curve2":"The audio world has shifted.

Along with fine detail, it delivers rich, natural-looking color and both a high enough contrast ratio and the subtle shading needed to add a convincing sense of three dimensionality. Surprisingly, given the visibly high contrast, a solid black image has a noticeable glow in a dark room. However, the black areas don't get any brighter if you add bright elements to the image, which is the more important factor for contrast.\n\n\tThere is also no visible change in black level when you change brightness by adjusting the power level, which has settings from 50% to 100% in 5% increments. So the higher the power level, the better the contrast will be. If you use the UHZ65 with a small screen in a dark room, you may have to settle for somewhat lower contrast, since the higher power levels may be too bright. However, this won't be an issue for the screen sizes you need in order to see all the detail available at 3820x2160 resolution, particularly in a room with ambient light.\n\n\t \n\n\tColor accuracy with default settings for the Cinema color preset is good enough to use straight out of the box. There's a slight blue bias compared with a calibrated projector, but it is easy to adjust to neutral color. And unlike most color presets for DLP projectors, Cinema mode is designed to offer accurate colors with Brilliant Color at 10--the highest setting--for maximum white brightness. Most of the same comments apply to Reference mode, except that its default setting for Brilliant Color is 1, which translates to being off. Reference mode also has lower contrast than Cinema mode.\n\n\tBright mode has an obvious magenta shift with default settings, but color accuracy improves significantly if you drop Brilliant Color to 1 from the default of 10. Game mode maintains color accuracy fairly well and delivers good contrast, but it loses subtle gradations the eye uses as cues to three dimensionality. The loss in depth won't matter for games and animations, and the high contrast will be a plus.\n\n\tThere's also an HDR Sim mode that's meant to add an HDR look to SDR content by enhancing gamma, contrast, and color saturation. The enhancement goes a little too far, however, leading to oversaturated color. The actual HDR mode is available for HDR input only, and does a far better job.\n\n\tYou can customize any of the preset color modes or the one User mode to taste. In addition, the UHZ65 is ISF certified, so if you pay an ISF-certified technician to calibrate it, the menus will also include ISF Day and Night modes. The color modes in the menu also includes 3D, but there is no support for Blu-ray 3D. The UHZ65 supports only PC-based 3D.\n\n\t \n\n\tOptoma's version of Frame Interpolation (FI) is called PureMotion. As with any version of FI it introduces a digital video effect that can be a distraction for watching film but can enhance the crispness of live or recorded video.\n\n\t \n\n\tWith default settings for Cinema mode, PureMotion is on and set to 1, the lowest of its three levels. Level 1 smoothes motion only a little while adding a slight, but obvious, digital video effect. Both increase at each step, with judder completely gone at the highest level, and filmed content looking like live video in most scenes. I didn't see any motion artifacts at the lowest level, and fewer artifacts at the highest than with most FI features. You can also turn FI off if you prefer.\n\n\tVideo Optimized Lumens. The Cinema and Reference color presets both offer close to accurate color without any adjustments. Cinema delivering the brighter image of the two, and it doesn't lose any brightness if you adjust it to eliminate the slight blue bias. At 1633 lumens, it is bright enough for a 185\" diagonal 16:9 image in a dark room or a 115\" image with moderate ambient light.\n\n\tPresentation Optimized Lumens. The UHZ65 is obviously not designed primarily for presentations, but it can handle them well. Bright mode with default settings is the obvious choice for presentations that don't include photos. Some colors are significantly shifted, but the 2845 lumens can give you a 130\" or larger image that can stand up to ambient light.\n\n\tLow Lamp Modes. The 10 steps in power levels below 100% behave as advertised, lowering the measured brightness by 5% of the full brightness at each step down to 50%.\n\n\tZoom Lens effect. The 1.6x zoom lens offers good flexibility for how far you can position the projector from the screen, but with enough loss of brightness to notice. At the full telephoto setting, the lens curtails light by about 23% compared with the wide-angle setting. That's not unusual for a 1.6x zoom lens. But it is enough that for maximum brightness, you'll want the UHZ65 as close to the screen as possible.\n\n\tBrightness uniformity. The 56% measured brightness uniformity is unusually low a home theater projector. The variation across the screen is easy to see with a solid white image, with the left and right sides obviously not as bright as the broad center swath. Fortunately, most film and video images break up the field of view enough to effectively hide the variation, and the eye will tend to interpret any visible difference as being part of the original image. It helps too that the brightness drops off only near the edges of the screen, where you're least likely to be looking while watching a movie.\n\n\tInput Lag. Using 1080p content, the input lag with all color modes is 80 ms with FI off and 147 ms with FI on at any setting.\n\n\tLow Rainbow Activity. With three different movies, I saw rainbow artifacts occasionally in one, less often in another, and exceedingly rarely in a third. Few people, if any, should find them bothersome.\n\n\tOn-Board Stereo. Any projector that costs as much as the UHZ65 pretty much demands being paired with a high quality external sound system. That said, the UHZ65 includes two on-board 4-watt stereo speakers if you need them. Sound quality is on a par with a typical large-screen TV, and the volume is enough to fill a good-size family room.\n\n\tOne minor issue with movies on 1080p Blu-ray discs is that if you jump ahead or back the audio and video fall out of sync with no easy way to match them up again. However, this happened only when I allowed the Blu-ray player to auto connect at 3840x2160 and upscale the image. When I set it to connect at 1080p, and let the UHZ65 upscale the image, the audio and video stayed in sync.\n\n\tFan Noise. Optoma rates fan noise at 33dB at 100% power and 29dB at 50%, which makes it a little louder than most home theater projectors. At 100%, you can hear it from 10 feet away at quiet moments as a steady, low-pitched whoosh. But even from 5 feet it will fade into the background for anyone who isn't particularly bothered by noise. At 50% power, the fan noise is low enough that it is unlikely anyone will find it bothersome from 5 feet away.\n\n\tHigh Altitude mode, which Optoma recommends using at 5,000 feet and above, is loud enough at all power settings to notice in quiet moments from anywhere in a typical-size home theater. If you need to use High Altitude mode, and particularly if fan noise is one of your pet peeves, consider positioning the projector behind a false wall or behind the screen to help deaden the sound.\n\n\tLamp life. The laser-phosphor engine is meant to last the life of the projector.

This alignment and grille lens technology creates imaging realism and frequency balance unheard of in small, high performance satellite speakers.\n\t\n\tCurved Enclosure Design\n\tEmploys non-parallel surfaces that not only lead to a stronger, more rigid and acoustically inert enclosure, but they also result in less audible coloration from internal surface resonances. We've literally designed-out the usual limitations of small-enclosures. It's a new category of compact loudspeaker: the kind that sounds amazing. (And looks great doing it.)\n\t\n\tDynamic Balance® Driver Technology\n\tIf you could tune out the bad sounds before they even happen, you'd do it, wouldn't you? Polk Audio's patented Dynamic Balance process allows us to design our drivers specifically for flatter frequency response, revealing the sharpest details and a more lifelike transparency, with absolutely no strain even at high volume. It's a bold, rich, warm and lifelike sound.\n\t\n\tHi-Gloss \"Blackstone\" Finish\n\tA durable, deep automotive-strength finish that matches today's most stylish flat-panel TVs and the decor they live in: yours.\n\t\n\tMultiple Mounting Options\n\tCompact means go-anywhere for Blackstone TL: on shelves, on the wall, on stands.

The two new bass drivers are each loaded through our special floor loading with side vents, this makes the loudspeaker easier to sight and reacts less to surroundings.\n\n\t \n\n\tSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n\t- Nominal Impedance: 4 Ohms\n\n\t- Recommend Amplifier: 10 to 250 watts\n\n\t- Frequency Response: 20Hz - 30kHz\n\n\t- Sensitivity: 90 dB linear for 1 watt at 1 metre\n\n\t- Bass/Midrange: 2 x 6 1/2 inch (165mm) ProAc unit studio monitor design with special coating and dust cap tuning.\n\n\t- Tweeter: Tweeter D48R - ProAc ribbon 60mm x 10mm 'light as a human hair' with rear chamber damping.\n\n\tTweeter D48 - ProAc 1 inch (25 mm) soft dome with special surround and inner damping.\n\n\t- Dimensions: in mm H x W x D: 47 1/4 inch (1200mm) high on plinths with spikes\n\n\t8 1/3 inch (212mm) wide\n\n\t13 1/2 inch (340mm) deep\n\n\t- Grille: Acoustically transparent crimlene\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2287/1/ResponseD48R.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2287/2/34880-5.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2287/3/RD481.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2287/4/usv_proac_d48r_rosewood_4.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1388","curve":"ProJect Elemental (SALE 2020)","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=promo","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1388/1/Untitled-1elementalsilver.jpg","curve2":"Pro-Ject Elemental  \nManual turntable  \n\n ","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 3.499.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1388","Title":"ProJect Elemental (SALE 2020)","Text":"\n\t• Belt drive system  \n\n\t• Integrated motor control with DC power supply secures silent running  \n\n\t• Central gravity mass point made from artificial stone  \n\n\t• Main platter bearing made from stainless steel runs in bronze bushing with Teflon bottom  \n\n\t• Low resonance particle board platter with felt mat  \n\n\t• 8,6” ultra low mass tonearm with straight arm tube  \n\n\t• Pre-adjusted tracking force & antiskating  \n\n\t• Gold-plated RCA contacts & cartridge pins  \n\n\t• Colour options: red-black, white-black, silver-black  \n\n\t \n\n\t• Dust cover \"Cover It E\" separately available\n\n\tPro-Ject Elemental  \n\tManual turntable  \n\t\n\t \n\n\tBest buy turntable with maximum simplicity & outstanding sound quality!\n\n\t \n\n\tPro-Ject has decided to go after the cheap plastic turntable market with an high quality alternative that comes complete with an Ortofon cartridge.

A second line level input allows you to connect a CD, DVD, Blu-ray player or any other ‘line level’ source.\n\n\t\"A brilliant audio solution for nearly every requirement\"\n\n\t\n\n\tWhat’s the best way to use my Q–BT3 speakers?\n\n\tThe best way to experience the full capability of the new Q-BT3 is connect it to your television or set-top box and enjoy it as a high quality, wireless hi-fi mini system at the same time! To make life even easier, you can control the volume and switch between inputs on your Q-BT3 either with the small, elegant, infrared remote control included; or by the remote controls which come with many satellite and cable TV boxes, (including UK ‘Sky’ and ‘Virgin’ models).\n\n\t \n\n\tWhere can I put my speakers?\n\n\tThe Q Acoustic BT3 speakers can be placed almost anywhere. They can be wall mounted with an appropriate bracket or placed on a speaker stand, furniture or bookshelf. Therefore whether you want to experience the full force of the latest blockbuster movie or listen to your favourite music, one thing guaranteed is that the stylish Q-BT3 Bluetooth speaker system will enhance your enjoyment.\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\tHow they work\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tCan I use my iPhone or other Smartphone to connect wirelessly to my Q-BT3 speakers?\n\t\n\t\tFor ultimate flexibility and convenience, we’ve incorporated state of the art V4.0 Bluetooth technology (with aptX for near CD quality sound) into the Q-BT3, which allows you to listen to music from any Bluetooth enabled Smartphone, Tablet or laptop. Then simply enjoy your music with the freedom and convenience that only a wireless connection can bring. This innovative product can be enjoyed in many different ways, from many different devices.\n\t\n\t\tAre these the best Bluetooth speakers around?\n\t\n\t\tWe’re completely confident the Q Acoustic Q-BT3 Bluetooth speakers set the standard at their price. The new Q-BT3 isn’t a jazzed up iPod dock or modified table radios in disguise. As stated above, the Q-BT3 looks and sounds like a pair of genuine, superior quality hi-fi loudspeakers, for the very obvious and simple reason; that’s precisely what they are.\n\t\n\t\tNever miss what is going on\n\t\n\t\tThe amazing thing about these is that you will never miss an important phone call or message again. You can listen to your music, however when your phone or device goes off, it dims the sound and alerts you. Therefore you can always stay connected, whether it is a message from your friends or an important business phone call, you can be alerted.\n\t\n\t\tAre these the best TV speakers around?\n\t\n\t\tWell, we’re too modest to say, but they’re certainly great value and will deliver an audio performance that comfortably outperforms typical soundbars and other dedicated TV speakers. Appearance wise Q-BT3 looks just like a pair of small, neat and stylish real hi-fi loudspeakers – because, under the skin, that’s just what they are (and a lot more!) Placed either side of your TV, the BT3 speakers can connect to your television or set-top box for you to experience fabulous TV sound quality. Q Acoustics BT3 is ideal for television and movie lovers alike and for those who want to ‘feel the earth move’, there’s a separate subwoofer output to connect your subwoofer of choice.\n\t\n\t\tLess clutter, more sound\n\t\n\t\tThe Q Media BT3 has been specially designed to dramatically improve the sound from your TV. Volume levels can also be controlled via the remotes from many satellite and cable TV boxes, (including 'Sky' and 'Virgin' models). Therefore you can experience movies, music and sport like never before without searching for that ‘other remote’. In addition the BT3 has a built- in amplifier, therefore there is no need for a separate amp. This all adds up to less clutter in your lounge.\n\t\n\t\tCan they be used with my laptop or computer?\n\t\n\t\tQuite simply, yes! The BT3s make for great desktop speakers. They are small enough so that they will not clutter up your desk, and will deliver a performance that will ‘wow’ you. The BT3s take your listening experience to the next level. No longer will you have to complain about the poor sound quality, whether you are Skyping a friend, downloading music or watching something online.\n\t\n\t\tWhy should I use these speakers for my laptop or computer?\n\t\n\t\tThe BT3s deliver a sound far beyond that you get out of your laptop or computer. With the built in amplifiers the BT3s work particularly well for musicians that enjoy recording their own music as it is like bringing the recording studio to your very own home. They are also great for gaming, helping you get more involved in the experience, almost like you’re actually in the game itself.\n\t\n\t\tFeatures\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tReal hi-fi speakers, which connect wirelessly\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGenuine stereo sound from all your home entertainment media\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tShelf, stand or table mount in portrait or landscape\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWarranty: 2 Years\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tTechnical specification\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDimensions (W x H x D): 148mm x 240mm x 226mm (each)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPower output: 2 x 50W\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSpeakers\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBass unit: 100mm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTreble unit: 25mm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tConnection options\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBluetooth V4.0 including aptX\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAnalogue 3.5 mm stereo jack socket\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAnalogue RCA phono sockets\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDigital optical (Toslink)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSubwoofer output (RCA)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSpeaker terminals\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn the box\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1 x active (right) and 1 x passive (left) speaker\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRemote control (battery included)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t2 metre 3.5mm jack lead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t2 metre RCA phono lead\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t4 metre speaker cable\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUK AC mains cable\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEU AC mains cable\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUser manual\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe \"aptX software is copyright CSR plc or its group companies.

It is the newest addition of the acclaimed, award winning Concept range and, like so many Q Acoustics models, delivers an unparalleled sonic performance at its price. We firmly believe the Concept 40 sets new standards, even outperforming many speakers in higher price brackets.\n\n\tIn common with the Concept 20, its award-winning ‘little brother’, the new Concept 40’s extraordinary soundstage, dynamics and sheer musicality is achieved by incorporating its bespoke drive units into a ‘GelcoreTM Construction’ cabinet. This State-of-the-Art, ultra-low resonance and beautifully lacquered cabinet design allows the drive units to perform at their very impressive best.\n\n\tThe low distortion drive units incorporate powerful oversized magnets to ensure wide dynamics and an ultra-fast transient response. The elegant tripod stand allows the Concept 40 to achieve perfect rigidity and floor contact which further enhances its performance.\n\n\tEven the speaker’s attractive aluminium facia plate is not purely decorative. It’s part of an assembly which clamps a butyl rubber sheet to the front panel to reduce cabinet resonance still further.\n\n\tWith 90dB sensitivity and a nominal impedance of 6 ohms, the Concept 40 is easily driven by any good quality amplifier. This striking floorstanding loudspeaker is available in either high gloss black, or high gloss white finishes.\n\n\t \n\n\tREVIEWS :\n\n\tHiFi Choice June 2014\n\n\t“Superlative … brilliantly balanced package …. excellent value” ..... “Wonderfully clean and open ... bass is surprisingly strong … the midband is a joy”\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\tWhat HiFi?

Concept 500 is the culmination of Q Acoustics continual evolution and refinement resulting in what we believe is sonic perfection.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDesigned to appeal to discerning audiophiles, the Concept 500 achieves a perfect balance between art and science. It is a loudspeaker that is at once, stylish, contemporary, fine-sounding and astonishingly accurate. It couples low directivity with wide bandwidth, good sensitivity and sensible impedance. This makes the new Concept 500 both room-friendly and an easy load to drive, allowing amplifiers to deliver their best performance.\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\tTo create a stereo soundstage which gives as good an impression of width, depth and height as that found in a live performance requires high quality drive units, a well designed crossover and an accurately constructed cabinet. To achieve this, Q Acoustics formed a truly talented team with many years of experience in the design, engineering and manufacture of world-class loudspeakers. A combination that resulted in a state-of-the-art loudspeaker worthy of any high-end system.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tRead Review\n\t      \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tRead Review\n\t            \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tMore Information\n\t\tWatch Video\n\n\n\t\n\t\tFind your nearest Elite Dealer\n\n\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFind your nearest dealer where you can see and hear our premium products, including CONCEPT 500, everywhere in the world.

As with all our Install products they feature protective driver dust covers and cloth backed grilles to facilitate painting. The HF is adjustable by + or - 3dB from a switch on the crossover. These speakers are clutter free due to being installed within the ceiling itself which gives you more space to do what else you may wish. These speakers can also withstand the harshest of elements that means you can enjoy them both indoors and outdoors, whilst using the mono speaker technology that gives you great sound. These allow you to be able to listen to music throughout your home or work place, both inside and outside, where this was previously not possible. These are great for adding your own personal touch, and bring in more of an atmosphere.\n\n\t \n\n\tFeatures: \n\n\t\n\t\tAll the in-ceiling models boast a 6.5” (165mm) polypropylene cone.

","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=961","Title":"","Text":"\n\tThe Audio 40 cable range is an entirely new design concept from QED labs. The cordage is designed primarily for low capacitance as this has been identified by QED as a significant  factor which leads to a high fidelity experience, making for a tight sound and retaining the rhythm of the original piece. Add our Complementary Conductor TechnologyTM for high frequency detail and our Analoc TechnologyTM to maximise signal integrity and the result is what we feel to be the most innovative interconnect ever made by QED. Please see our 'cables matter' section below for more in-depth information on this ground breaking design.\n\n\tAWARDS AND REVIEWS\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAV Tech media, Awards 2014/15\n\t\n\t\tRead Full Review\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t\"Build quality and feel are very reassuring - you're immediately drawn to the smart looking 'Analoc' locking plugs.\"\n\n\t \n\n\tWhat Hi-Fi? Sound and Vision June 2014\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t \n\n\n\tHi-Fi Choice Group Test Winner, August 2014\n\n\tLike most interconnects here, the Reference Audio 40 is a silver-plated copper affair, arranged in a special complementary way – the two conductors have different diameters, and this is said to give an alternative path for high-frequency audio signals to avoid time smear. The foamed polyethylene dielectric is claimed to reduce the amount of signal lost to cable capacitance. QED’s Analoc plugs are fitted, said to be a low eddy current design with copper instead of brass used. They feature an outer locking cylinder that needs to be screwed forward before the plug’s ‘blades’ can be locked onto the RCA phono socket, then the locking cylinder needs to tightened backup for a (very) secure fit. The Signature Revelation speaker cable uses 10 silver-plated oxygen- free copper central conductors, which are claimed to provide very low resistance alongside high levels of detail. These cores are separately insulated and arranged around a hollow core of polyethylene; QED calls this its Aircore technology and it’s claimed to reduce inductance.\n\n\tSound Quality\n\n\tBefore the QED loom, the panellists have taken a mixed view of the various wires played to them. They’ve found positives and negatives, liked some and been lukewarm about others. But two out of the three listeners express a strong preference for this set of cables, applauding it for its clean, open, even sound that doesn’t try to do anything too clever. Instead it is very accomplished at almost every facet of the music, and makes things look rather easy.\n\n\t“Everything is joined up,” says one panellist, and so it proves. The Lorde track plays better than it has through most others here. Although not necessarily the warmest or most expansive, it just seems to gel the bass with the rest of the music – which is something several others fail to do.It doesn’t sound too steely in the midband, giving a nice smooth sound to female vocals, and treble is crisp and finessed. Musically the loom works very well, the beat bouncing along in an enjoyable way. The result is a surprisingly easy listen, when previously the track hasn’t quite made sense.The REM tune is described as sounding, “head and shoulders better” by one panellist. There is a fine sense of depth to what can sound a pretty close and claustrophobic mix. One can hear lots of detail too, with the keyboard backing track coming through from the second verse, where previously it had been submerged. Tonally the QED isn’t the warmest or most sumptuous here, but it is very even and transparent and doesn’t seem to be trying to add or subtract anything much. This means that it’s likely to work well with a wide range of systems. Moving to the Duke Ellington piece and the pattern continues. One adoring panellist describes it as, “good bass rhythm and control, nice, cohesive, great sound, head and shoulders better”.Another of the panellists isn’t quite so enamoured; they appear to yearn for the expansive yet sumptuous midband of the Ecosse, and find the QED a little too anodyne and bland when playing Julian Lloyd Webber’s cello work. All of which just goes to show how much taste plays a part, but still this remains a superb result considering its low price\n\n\t \n\n\tFEATURES AND BENEFITS :\n\n\tComplementary Conductor TechnologyTM\n\n\t\n\t\tThis innovation utilises two conductors of different diameters to carry the same audio signal. This has the effect of providing an alternative path for high frequency audio components which might otherwise become time smeared in a single audio pathway.\n\t\n\t\tFOAMED POLYETHYLENE DIELECTRIC\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFoamed Polyethylene has a low dielectric constant and has been used to cut down on the amount of audio signal energy lost due to cable capacitance.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tANALOCTM Locking RCA Plugs\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe new QED Analoc™ plug is a low eddy current design featuring small high purity copper\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tconductors in place of the usual large volume brass body found in ordinary high quality plugs. This cuts down or eliminates the tendency for the changing magnetic field in the conductor to induce eddy currents which can affect the micro-timing of the audio signal.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSPECIFICATIONS :\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSilver Plated 99.999% Oxygen Free Copper(SPOFC) conductors with LDPE dielectric\n\t\t\t\tAsymmetrical twisted pair geometry\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOFC shield giving 100% electromagnetic screening\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tZn/Mn ferrite Jacket\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGold plated QED ‘Analoc™’ RCA plugs\n\t\t\t\tCapacitance: 76pF/m\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInductance: 0.37uH/m\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLoop resistance: 0.072 Ω/m\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDissipation Factor: 0.0059\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/961/1/audio4banner.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/961/2/7c8b6cacb11230403cd1f86670c25709.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/961/3/ref_audio_40.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/961/4/analoc-instructions.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2117","curve":"QED Reference Audio XLR 40 Analogue Interconnect Cable 1m","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2117/1/QEDXLR40Analogue.jpg","curve2":"XLR 40 is designed primarily for low capacitance as this has been identified by QED as a major factor which leads to a high fidelity experience.

The foamed polyethylene dielectric is claimed to reduce the amount of signal lost to cable capacitance. QED’s Analoc plugs are fitted, said to be a low eddy current design with copper instead of brass used. They feature an outer locking cylinder that needs to be screwed forward before the plug’s ‘blades’ can be locked onto the RCA phono socket, then the locking cylinder needs to tightened backup for a (very) secure fit. The Signature Revelation speaker cable uses 10 silver-plated oxygen- free copper central conductors, which are claimed to provide very low resistance alongside high levels of detail. These cores are separately insulated and arranged around a hollow core of polyethylene; QED calls this its Aircore technology and it’s claimed to reduce inductance.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSound Quality\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBefore the QED loom, the panellists have taken a mixed view of the various wires played to them. They’ve found positives and negatives, liked some and been lukewarm about others. But two out of the three listeners express a strong preference for this set of cables, applauding it for its clean, open, even sound that doesn’t try to do anything too clever. Instead it is very accomplished at almost every facet of the music, and makes things look rather easy.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t“Everything is joined up,” says one panellist, and so it proves. The Lorde track plays better than it has through most others here. Although not necessarily the warmest or most expansive, it just seems to gel the bass with the rest of the music – which is something several others fail to do.It doesn’t sound too steely in the midband, giving a nice smooth sound to female vocals, and treble is crisp and finessed. Musically the loom works very well, the beat bouncing along in an enjoyable way. The result is a surprisingly easy listen, when previously the track hasn’t quite made sense.The REM tune is described as sounding, “head and shoulders better” by one panellist. There is a fine sense of depth to what can sound a pretty close and claustrophobic mix. One can hear lots of detail too, with the keyboard backing track coming through from the second verse, where previously it had been submerged. Tonally the QED isn’t the warmest or most sumptuous here, but it is very even and transparent and doesn’t seem to be trying to add or subtract anything much. This means that it’s likely to work well with a wide range of systems. Moving to the Duke Ellington piece and the pattern continues. One adoring panellist describes it as, “good bass rhythm and control, nice, cohesive, great sound, head and shoulders better”.Another of the panellists isn’t quite so enamoured; they appear to yearn for the expansive yet sumptuous midband of the Ecosse, and find the QED a little too anodyne and bland when playing Julian Lloyd Webber’s cello work. All of which just goes to show how much taste plays a part, but still this remains a superb result considering its low price\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2133/1/SignatureRevelationroll.jpg","Image_URL_2":"","Image_URL_3":"","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1997","curve":"QED Silver Anniversary XT 2M (PACKAGED)","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1997/1/QEDANNIV2M.jpg","curve2":"Reference Silver Anniversary XT\nThe multi-award winning Silver Anniversary XT cable delivers superior performance for all your hi-fi and home theatre needs\n\nSilver Anniversary-XT has been specifically designed as the natural replacement for the multi-award winning Silver Anniversary speaker cable.

The foamed polyethylene dielectric is claimed to reduce the amount of signal lost to cable capacitance. QED’s Analoc plugs are fitted, said to be a low eddy current design with copper instead of brass used. They feature an outer locking cylinder that needs to be screwed forward before the plug’s ‘blades’ can be locked onto the RCA phono socket, then the locking cylinder needs to tightened backup for a (very) secure fit. The Signature Revelation speaker cable uses 10 silver-plated oxygen- free copper central conductors, which are claimed to provide very low resistance alongside high levels of detail. These cores are separately insulated and arranged around a hollow core of polyethylene; QED calls this its Aircore technology and it’s claimed to reduce inductance.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSound Quality\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBefore the QED loom, the panellists have taken a mixed view of the various wires played to them. They’ve found positives and negatives, liked some and been lukewarm about others. But two out of the three listeners express a strong preference for this set of cables, applauding it for its clean, open, even sound that doesn’t try to do anything too clever. Instead it is very accomplished at almost every facet of the music, and makes things look rather easy.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t“Everything is joined up,” says one panellist, and so it proves. The Lorde track plays better than it has through most others here. Although not necessarily the warmest or most expansive, it just seems to gel the bass with the rest of the music – which is something several others fail to do.It doesn’t sound too steely in the midband, giving a nice smooth sound to female vocals, and treble is crisp and finessed. Musically the loom works very well, the beat bouncing along in an enjoyable way. The result is a surprisingly easy listen, when previously the track hasn’t quite made sense.The REM tune is described as sounding, “head and shoulders better” by one panellist. There is a fine sense of depth to what can sound a pretty close and claustrophobic mix. One can hear lots of detail too, with the keyboard backing track coming through from the second verse, where previously it had been submerged. Tonally the QED isn’t the warmest or most sumptuous here, but it is very even and transparent and doesn’t seem to be trying to add or subtract anything much. This means that it’s likely to work well with a wide range of systems. Moving to the Duke Ellington piece and the pattern continues. One adoring panellist describes it as, “good bass rhythm and control, nice, cohesive, great sound, head and shoulders better”.Another of the panellists isn’t quite so enamoured; they appear to yearn for the expansive yet sumptuous midband of the Ecosse, and find the QED a little too anodyne and bland when playing Julian Lloyd Webber’s cello work. All of which just goes to show how much taste plays a part, but still this remains a superb result considering its low price\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1134/1/SignatureRevelation.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1134/2/QEDSpeakerCableRevelation282.0m29.2.jpg","Image_URL_3":"","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2335","curve":"QED Supremus Cable Speaker 2x3m","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2335/1/supremus_1.jpg","curve2":"QED Supremus 2x3m\n","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 21.000.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2335","Title":"QED Supremus Cable Speaker 2x3m","Text":"\n\tSUPREMUS\n\n\tQED Supremus loudspeaker cable is the ultimate expression of sound born of pure science.\n\n\tDeveloped without compromise, it has been 21 years in the making.\n\n\t \n\n\tSupremus Speaker Cable\n\n\tThe largest cross sectional area of pure copper ever incorporated into a QED loudspeaker cable, enables Supremus to deliver the ultra-low resistance required to ensure perfect fidelity of the musical signal.\n\n\t \n\n\tAirCoreTM Technology, unique to QED cables, means unrivalled high frequency detail, rhythm and timing.\n\n\t \n\n\tSupremus Plugs Supremus boasts sixteen silver plated, 99.999% oxygen free copper, solid core conductors.

It took the completion of two of our multi award winning products, the flagship Isis CD player and the Rega DAC to pave the way for a unique product we feel encapsulates everything the new Apollo-R should be.\n\n\t\n\tDesign history\n\tThe original Apollo CD player launched in 2005. It was a huge success selling approaching 20,000 units worldwide. The Apollo was a unique player featuring Rega’s own software and control system ensuring no other manufacturers player could sound the same. This key element is carried forward and improved into Apollo-R.\n\n\t\n\tAnalogue & digital outputs\n\tDevelopment of the analogue, digital and control domains ensured direct improvements of both analogue and digital outputs making the Apollo-R a perfect partner for the Rega Brio-R amplifier and an ideal ‘CD format’ front-end for the Rega DAC. The Apollo-R internal circuitry has also been improved by tightening the PCB layout.\n\n\t\n\tCompact case design\n\tApollo-R is a top loading design housed in a custom compact aluminium case matching the Rega DAC and Brio-R amplifier. The Apollo-R is available in both black or satin silver finish.\n\n\t\n\tDedicated CD mini system remote control\n\tA new dedicated CD remote handset is supplied as standard which also has the advantage of Rega amplifier functionality .\n\n\t\n\tDigital to analogue conversion\n\tThe DAC and the output amplifier of the Apollo-R have been enhanced using the Wolfson WM8742 digital to analogue converter, the same integrated circuit found in the Rega DAC.\n\n\t\n\tPower supplies\n\tThe ‘digital’ power supplies feeding the CD processor, optical block, laser diode amplifier and slicer have been enhanced. This is achieved by using the same high performance low noise power supplies found in the same location within the Isis CD player. This vastly improves the playability, error correction and the ‘inner core’ processing of the digital CD ‘spinner’ part of the Apollo-R.\n\n\t\n\tOutput amplifier\n\tThe discrete output amplifier has been tweaked to reduce the overall THD from typically 0.005% to 0.0025%, whilst at the same time improving the overall sound quality of the output amplifier.\n\n\t\n\tUser interface\n\tWe have improved the user interface control by using a dedicated display microprocessor, which eases the workload on the main control processors giving an improvement in the control code stability, usability and improved speed of initialisation of the disc being played which now matches that of the Isis CD player.\n\n\tFeatures :\n\n\t\n\t\tNew Wolfson WM8742 DAC\n\t\n\t\tEnhanced Output amplifier circuit.\n\t\n\t\tEnhanced Digital power supplies.\n\t\n\t\tImproved User interface.\n\t\n\t\tRedeveloped Analogue & Digital outputs.\n\t\n\t\tCD remote with amplifier functionality.\n\n\n\tBrio-R\n\n\tThe Brio–R embodies all the necessary ingredients. Substantial toroidal transformer, generous power supply components, rugged output stage, the use of film capacitors in the signal path and at all critical positions within the phono amplifier.\n\n\tNew output amplifier \n\tDeveloped by our engineers a newly designed output amplifier using a low source impedance emitter follower Class A driver stage. Based around a complementary pair of 150w Sanken Darlington output transistors, this combination forms a complementary emitter follower emulating Class A conditions with good thermal stability and lower standing currents in the driver stage.\n\n\tRemote Control\n\tRemote control has been added to the Brio-R without compromising the sonic design of the amplifier. This was achieved by keeping the remote circuit separate to the audio circuit and having its own dedicated power supply.\n\tThere is no direct contact between the micro-controller and the signal path, the micro-controller controls the relays whilst the volume control motor uses DC control voltages.\n\n\tHigh quality components\n\tThe Brio-R utilises the highest quality components and our engineers' experience to achieve the best sonic performance.\n\tEnsuring it is the most advanced and feature packed Brio to date.\n\n\tImproved power supplies\n\tDuring the Brio-R design process Rega reviewed the circuit and improved the low and high current power supplies, coupling and bypass capacitors. The phono stage has been improved to reflect the current improvements in the Rega Planar turntables, where the input sensitivity has been increased along with a revision of the\n\tsub 100Hz part of the phono frequency response.\n\n\tCustom Case & Design\n\tHoused in a brand new custom case the Brio-R draws on the pedigree of the previous three incarnations of this model.\n\tThe sonic recipe for the Brio-R embodies the best in traditional audio circuits with excellent engineering practice.\n\n\tThe Brio-R, in Silver satin metal finish.\n\n\tRead ToneAudio's Brio-R Review here...\n\n\t \n\n\tFeatures :\n\n\t\n\t\t50w RMS pc into 8W\n\t\n\t\t73w RMS pc into 4W\n\t\n\t\tRemote control\n\t\n\t\t5 inputs\n\t\n\t\tRega brand new custom manufactured case.\n\t\n\t\tRega phono stage (Input 1)\n\t\n\t\tToroidal mains transformer\n\t\n\t\tSanken 150w output transistors\n\n\n\tQ Acoustics is proud to introduce the new Concept 20 Loudspeaker.\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\tThe 'Concept 20' is a special loudspeaker which goes beyond anything that Q Acoustics has achieved before.

The PCB layout has been fully upgraded to handle higher specifications for all critical parts. A second raw power supply has been added to provide further isolation between output stage and the driver stage/line and phono amplifiers. This improves the isolation between high and low level signal stages of the amplifier.

With the PC now widely accepted as a credible medium for storing and streaming music,the use of high quality lossless files such as WAV, FLAC and ALAC offer performance through the DAC-R equal to, and in some cases better than, Red Book CD. Great care has been taken to remove noise generated by the PC and other input sources. (During development\n\t\tthis was identified as a major drawback with many DAC’s on the market today). The DAC-R is housed in a custom aluminium and steel case and boasts a pair of Wolfson DAC IC’s, three user selectable digital filters and one isolated asynchronous USB, two isolated Co-axial inputs & two Toslink SPDIF inputs. The DAC-R has been designed and engineered to integrate perfectly into any system and achieve the highest performance in its class. We hope you enjoy this Rega product for many years to come.\n\t\n\t\tThe optical and coaxial input stage comprises a Wolfson digital receiver with a high stability, low jitter clock driving the receiver PLL. The receiver and PLL have their own dedicated power supplies.\n\t\n\t\tThe DAC stage comprises a pair of parallel-connected Wolfson WM8742 DAC’s, that are driven via a buffer stage, which ensures the integrity of the data being fed to the DAC IC’s similar to the arrangement used in the Isis reference CDP. The USB input stage is comprised of a bit perfect XMOS USB Audio 2.0 with asynchronous clocking. The USB input stage feeds the Optical and Coaxial input stage via an isolating transformer giving total isolation from\n\t\tthe host computer.\n\t\n\t\tThe output amplifier employs a discrete differential, multiple feedback filter and output amplifier, with a high cut-off frequency for use with higher sample rates. We decided not to use a sample rate converter and process the data at the incoming sample rate which keeps the signal processing to a minimum. Jitter was minimised by synchronously clocking the digital data with our receiver PLL (removing any jitter from the input signal). All the capacitors associated with the analogue signal path are audio grade bypassed with MMK polyester capacitors, and low impedance conductive polymer capacitors are used for DAC decoupling. The power supply utilizes a toroidal transformer, fast rectifier diodes and again audio grade capacitors. There is a power supply for the control micro controller, separate from the digital & analogue audio stages. Special attention being paid to the inter IC control signals ensures the control data noise is kept to a minimum.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\tTechinical Specification :\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDAC 2x Wolfson WM8742\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequency Response (100KΩ load) Filter 1 selected\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLow data rate 44.1/48kHz = 10Hz -0.05dB to (44.1K) 20.02kHz (48K) 21.7kHz -0.03dB\n\t\t\t\t\tMedium data rate 88.2/96kHz = 10Hz -0.05dB to (88.1K) 28.7kHz (96K) 31.2kHz -3dB\n\t\t\t\t\tHigh data rate 176.4/192kHz = 10Hz -0.05dB to (176.4K) 44.1kHz (192K) 47.7kHz -3dB\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaximum output level\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.175V into 100KΩ load\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBit resolution (all inputs)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t16 to 24bit\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSupported data rates\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t32, 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, 192kHz\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTotal Harmonic Distortion all inputs (24bit 96kHz)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t0.006% @ 1kHz\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSignal to Noise Ratio\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t105dB (relative to maximum output level with a 100Hz to 22kHz bandwidth)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital inputs\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUSB Asynchronous Isolated (24bit 44.1/48/88.2/96/176.4/192kHz)\n\t\t\t\t\tInput 1 Optical/Toslink (24bit 32/44.1/48/88.2/96/176.4/192kHz)\n\t\t\t\t\tInput 2 Optical /Toslink (24bit 32/44.1/48/88.2/96/176.4/192kHz)\n\t\t\t\t\tInput 3 Isolated 75Ω Co-axial (24bit 32/44.1/48/88.2/96/176.4/192kHz)\n\t\t\t\t\tInput 4 Isolated 75Ω Co-axial (24bit32/44.1/48/88.2/96/176.4/192kHz)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital SPDIF outputs (via receiver & PLL)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOptical/Toslink\n\t\t\t\t\tIsolated 75Ω Co-axial\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPower\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t230v/115v/7.6W\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t W 215mm x D 320mm x H 80mm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRemote NEC system\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6E91\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWeight\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4.0 Kg\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/925/1/jkr.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/925/2/useDACRlowsidefront5B35D.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/925/3/useDACRlowsidefront5B15D.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/925/4/dac-r-back-panel.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=788","curve":"Rega Drive Belt Upgrade","curve_URL1":"","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/788/1/img-gallery-upgrade-drive-belt.jpg","curve2":"Upgrade Drive Belt for Rega Turntable","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 750.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=788","Title":"","Text":"\n\tUpgrade Drive Belt for Rega Turntable\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/788/1/img-gallery-upgrade-drive-belt.jpg","Image_URL_2":"","Image_URL_3":"","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=799","curve":"Rega Elex-R","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/799/1/regaelex-r.png","curve2":"The Elex-R is a sublime blend of the Brio-R design with the power circuits and advanced phono stage of the Elicit-R.

As part of the design we have included useful features like pre-amplifier output, to enable the new Elex-R amplifier to be used in a wide combination of systems and have avoided superfluous gadgets such as tone controls or a headphone socket as they can obstruct the signal path and degrade the produced sound quality.\n\n\tThe Elex-R has been built to Rega’s extremely high standards of reliability and quality to ensure many years of musical enjoyment. The primary function of an amplifier is to boost and equalize the low level signal generated by a phono cartridge, DAC and CD player or other source component to a level that can drive the loudspeakers. It is vital that the amplifier achieves this whilst minimising distortion, as this would directly affect the music. The distortion level is typically 0.007%; just under the clipping of the output.\n\n\tThe volume control and pre-amplifier used in the Elex-R is designed to overcome the problems associated with the standard arrangement. This design uses a custom chip along with peripheral support IC’s like a microcontroller and a custom made rotary volume control.\n\n\tThe Elex-R uses a combined feedback and passive volume control, where the feedback and input levels are varied to set the required volume level. The level and tracking between the two channels is set by the close tolerance parts in the pre-amplifier circuit and less by the actual potentiometer itself, thus keeping the mismatch of channels due to volume control tracking irregularities to a minimum.As well as keeping tracking irregularities to a minimum, this method also reduces noise and input overload as the control will only ‘use’ the required gain to amplify the signal.This form of volume control is normally only found in professional broadcast environments where accurate low noise control of levels is required.\n\n\t \n\n\tPower Amplifier Technology\n\n\tThe output amplifier used in the Elex-R, Elicit-R and Brio-R was born after extensive research by our engineers to develop a low source impedance emitter follower Class-A driver stage. This is based around a complementary pair of 150w Sanken Darlington output transistors. The technical and sonic improvement gained by the use of low impedance drivers is well known, however, it can feature high standing currents in the driver stage when using standard transistor configurations. By combining the low impedance driver with the Sanken Darlington transistors (with their imbedded thermal bias network running at a lower standing current) this combination forms a complementary emitter follower emulating Class-A conditions with good thermal stability with lower standing.\n\n\t \n\n\tTechnical Specification :\n\n\tKey features\n\n\t\n\t\tRega custom full width case with improved heat dissipation\n\t\n\t\tCombined feedback & passive volume control pre-amp\n\t\n\t\t90 watts per channel into 6 Ohms / 72 watts into 8ohms\n\t\n\t\tHigh specification integrated phono stage\n\t\n\t\tNew multi-lingual user manual\n\t\n\t\tEnhanced power supplies for the driver stage\n\t\n\t\tHybrid of the Brio-R and Elicit-R design\n\t\n\t\tDedicated mini remote handset included\n\t\n\t\tPre-amp out / Record out / 4 line inputs\n\t\n\t\tNew custom transformer\n\n\n\tSpecifications\n\n\t\n\t\tPower Supply\n\t\n\t\tVoltage: 230v & 115v\n\t\n\t\tFrequency: 60/60Hz\n\t\n\t\tPower Consumption: 250 Watts\n\t\n\t\t230v Fuse: T3.15AL 20mm\n\t\n\t\t115v Fuse: T5AL 20mm\n\n\n\tOutput power\n\n\t\n\t\t72.5W 8Ω both channels driven - Design centre rating    \n\t\n\t\t90W 6Ω both channels driven - Rega speaker impedance rating\n\t\n\t\t113W 4Ω both channels driven\n\n\n\tPhono input\n\n\t\n\t\tSensitivity (72.5W 8Ω1.7mV (Load 47K in parallel with 220pF)\n\t\n\t\tMaximum input level: 100mV\n\n\n\tLine input\n\n\t\n\t\tSensitivity (72.5W 8Ω 164mv (Load 30-50K)\n\t\n\t\tMaximum input level: 10v\n\n\n\tTape output\n\n\t\n\t\tLevel: 164mV with rated input\n\t\n\t\tOutput impedance: 470\n\n\n\tLine output\n\n\t\n\t\tLevel: 625mV with rated input\n\t\n\t\tOutput impedance: 600\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/799/1/regaelex-r.png","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/799/2/img-gallery-amps-elex-r-front.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/799/3/img-gallery-amps-elex-r-volume.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/799/4/img-gallery-amps-elex-r-mute.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=800","curve":"Rega Elicit-R","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=fivestar","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/800/1/elicitr.jpg","curve2":"The Elicit-R has been designed and engineered to the highest standard.

Those who have heard it tell an entirely different story.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSince 1982, when the CD was introduced, Rotel has been refining technology and evolving circuitry to bring you extraordinary sound. The RCD-1570, the outstanding CD player in Rotel‘s 15 series, focuses careful refinements to reveal even the most subtle nuances buried in a CD’s\n\t\t\t\tpit spiral.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOne of the RCD-1570’s most important features is the Wolfson WM8740 digital filter/stereo digital-to-analog converter. Originally developed for high resolution sources, it is the product of extensive research and real world testing and processes digital signals up to 24-bits in length at sampling rates from 8kHz to 192kHz. While word lengths and sampling speed may seem excessive for CDs delivering data at far lower rates, this high speed facility adds reserve capability to ensure proper reproduction under all circumstances. As the most crucial link between a CD’s digital data and the analog world in which we listen, this converter boasts significant attributes in addition to its superb high resolution capabilities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAnother advance is the RCD-1570’s slot-loading disc transport. In addition to mechanical simplicity and improved reliability, this design isolates the CD itself from potentially destructive vibration modes that may affect musical definition. And from a purely aesthetic viewpoint, it adds elegance by simplifying the front panel’s appearance.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe post-converter analog circuitry benefits from Rotel‘s decades-long experiences in crafting the finest sounding pathway from the D/A’s internal output to single and balanced rear panel connectors that bridge the gap between the RCD-1570 and down-stream components. All circuit components – resistors, capacitors, inductors – are chosen only after their positive contribution to sound quality were quantified and verified qualitatively by extensive listening sessions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAll of these circuits draw on a power supply based on an oversized custom Rotel-designed and precision manufactured toroidal power transformer that, in turn, feeds precise rectifiers, tight-tolerance voltage regulators, and advanced Slit-Foil low-ESR storage capacitors, all globally-sourced to ensure musically accurate operation under even the most demanding conditions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tXLR connectors provide balanced outputs, long recognized for their superior noise-rejecting characteristics while high quality RCA connectors provide an easy pathway to the myriad of components with single-ended inputs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThis is all part of Rotel’s long-proven Balanced Design Concept. It’s yet another way of assuring you that the RCD-1570 evidences a level of attention that will make it part of your reference-level music system for years to come.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore Specifications \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOutput Level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnbalanced (RCA): 2V\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBalanced (XLR): 4V\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital (Coax): 0.5V\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOutput Impedance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnbalanced (RCA): 100Ω\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBalanced (XLR): 200Ω\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDigital (Coax): 75Ω\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpeed, Accuracy, Wow & Flutter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuartz Crystal Precision\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCD Players\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBlack\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSilver\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRCD-1570\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe culmination of more than three decades of Rotel CD technology refinement, the RCD-1570 is the flagship CD player in Rotel‘s 15 Series.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWolfson premium\n\t\t\t\t24-bit/192kHz Digital to\n\t\t\t\tAnalog Converter\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSupports MP3 playback\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBalanced XLR outputs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIncludes remote control\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOptional rack ears available\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEngineered with care.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions (W × H × D)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t431 × 99 × 339mm\n\t\t\t\t\t17\" × 3.9\" × 13.4\"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFront Panel Height\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2U / 88.1mm (3.5\")\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPower Requirements\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t120V, 60Hz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPower Consumption\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t15W\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStandby Power Consumption\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t11.3W\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNet Weight\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6.7kg (15lbs.)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTU Rating\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t51 BTU/h\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t0.0045% @ 1kHz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequency Response\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t20Hz - 20kHz ±0.5dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tS/N Ratio (IHF \"A\" Weighted)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t>100dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDynamic Range\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t>96dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital to Analog Converters\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWolfson\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChannel Balance\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t±0.5dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChannel Separation\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t>98dB @ 1kHz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1405/1/Untitled-RotelRCD15701.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1405/2/RotelRCD1570s.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1405/3/ROTELrcd-1520aaaaaaaaaa.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1405/4/RotelRCD1570Blkang.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2063","curve":"ROTEL A11 Black Integrated Amplifier","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=promo","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2063/1/A11.jpg","curve2":"The A11 is a 50-watt per channel integrated amplifier that supports aptX and AAC for CD quality wireless audio streaming, with a Moving Magnet Phono Stage input for classic vinyl lovers and 4 RCA analog source inputs ensuring connectivity to all popular Hi-Fi equipment.","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 9.500.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2063","Title":"ROTEL A11 Black Integrated Amplifier","Text":"\n\tThe A11 is a 50-watt per channel integrated amplifier that supports aptX and AAC for CD quality wireless audio streaming, with a Moving Magnet Phono Stage input for classic vinyl lovers and 4 RCA analog source inputs ensuring connectivity to all popular Hi-Fi equipment.\n\n\t \n\n\tPRODUCT DESCRIPTION\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe A11 Integrated Amplifier is based on the successful 14 Series models.

One of the RCD-1572's most important features is the Wwolfson WM8740 digital filter/strero digital-to-analog converter. Originally developed for high resolution sources, it is the product of extensive research and real world testing and processes digital signals up to 250bits in length at sampling rates from 8 kHz to 192 kHz.\n\n\tWhile wword lengths and sampling speed may seem excessive for CDs delivering data at far lower rates, this high speed facility adds reserve capability to ensure proper reproduction under all circumtances. As the most crucial link between a CD's digital data and the analog world in which we listen, this converter boasts significant attributes in addition to its superb high resolution capabilities.\n\n\tThe post-converter analog circuitry benefits from Rotel's decades-long experiences in crafting the finest sounding pathway from the DAC's internal output to RCA and XLT rear panel conneectors that bridge the gap between the RCD-1572 and down-stream components. All circuit components - resistors, capacitors, inductors - are chosen only after their positive contribution to sound quality were quantified and verified qualitively by extensive listening sessions.\n\n\tAll of these circuits draw on a powwer supply based on an oversized custom Rotel-designed and precision-manufactured torodial power tranformer that, in turn, feeds precise rectifiers, tight-tolerance voltage regulators, and advanced Slit-Foil low-ESR storage capacitors, all globally sourced to ensure musically accurate operation under event the most demanding conditions.\n\n\tThis is all part of Rotel long-proves Balanced Design Concept. It's yet another way of assuring you that the RCD-1572 avidences a level of attention that will make it part of your reference-level music system for years to come\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEngineered with care.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions (W × H × D)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t431 × 104 × 320mm\n\t\t\t\t\t17\" × 4\" × 12.6\"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFront Panel Height\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2U / 88.1mm (3.5\")\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPower Requirements\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t230V, 50Hz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPower Consumption\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t15W\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStandby Power Consumption\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<0.5W\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNet Weight\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6.7kg (15lbs.)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBTU Rating\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t33 BTU/h\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t0.002% @ 1kHz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequency Response\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t20Hz - 20kHz ±0.5dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tS/N Ratio (IHF \"A\" Weighted)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t>118dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDynamic Range\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t>99dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital to Analog Converters\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWolfson 24-bit/192kHz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChannel Balance\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t±0.5dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChannel Separation\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t>115dB @ 10kHz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMORE SPECIFICATIONS:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOUTPUT LEVEL:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- Unbalanced (RCA): 2.2V\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- Balanced (XLR): 4.4V\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- Digital (Coax): 0.5V\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOUTPUT IMPEDANCE:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- Unbalanced (RCA): 100ohms\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- Balanced (XLR): 200ohms\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t- Digital (Coax): 75ohms\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2066/1/RCD1572.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2066/2/REVISIRCD1572FRONT.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2066/3/REVISI2RCD1572BLACK.jpg","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2070","curve":"ROTEL RMB 1512 Black Distribution Amplifier / Power Multi Ch","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=promo","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2070/1/RMB1512.jpg","curve2":"Rotel RMB-1512 is the ideal whole-house music amplifier with 12 x 100 Watts per channel.","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 35.100.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2070","Title":"ROTEL RMB 1512 Black Distribution Amplifier / Power Multi Ch","Text":"\n\tRotel RMB-1512 is the ideal whole-house music amplifier with 12 x 100 Watts per channel.\n\n\t \n\n\tPRODUCT DESCRIPTION\n\n\tNo Longer do you need to purchase several large amplifier to obtain a high performance multizone audio system.

The internal antennas on Performance Gear Wireless systems are already set in this ideal way, offering up to 75 m operating range and optimal signal strength.\n\t\tAdditionally internal antennas cannot be broken during setup, use or transport.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\tFeatures :\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHassle free setup\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInternal antennas simplify operation and storage\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOnly one channel select button\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA seven-segment LED indicated instantly if the selected channel is occupied\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tReliable wireless technology\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMicroprocessor controlled Predictive Diversity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t10 selectable frequencies\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUp to 4 compatible systems per band\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tSpecs :\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSystem technical specifications\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompatible systems per frequency band: 4\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSelectable frequencies: 10\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAuto Setup Features: No\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAudio Reference Companding: No\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIncluded Antennas: Internal 1/4-wave\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntenna Options: No\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReceiver Network Ability: No\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPC Control: No\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRack Hardware: Optional (URT)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCase: Optional System Case\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTransmitter Display: Multi-color LED\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReceiver Display: Multi-color LED\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBattery, Endurance: 9V, > 8 h\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnvironment: Small to medium stages, schools, karaoke\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFurther Technical Specs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPG88 Dual Receiver\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOutput Impedance XLR connector: 200 Ω 1/4 inch connector: 1kΩ\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAudio Output Level Ref.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t+/– 33 kHz deviation with\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1 kHz tone\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tXLR connector (into 100K Ω load): –19 dBV, typical\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1/4 inch connector (into 100K Ω load): –5 dBV, typical\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSensitivity –105 dBm for 12 dB SINAD, typical\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImage Rejection >50 dB, typical\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions 188 mm L x 103 mm W x 40 mm D (7.4 in. x 4.0 in. x 1.5 in.)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions - PG88 388 mm L x 116 mm W x 40 mm D (15.3 in. x 4 in. x 1.5 in.)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWeight 241 grams (8.5 oz)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWeight - PG88 429 grams (15.1 oz)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHousing Molded ABS\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPower Requirements 12–18 Vdc at 160 mA (PG4), 320mA (PG88), supplied by external power supply\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t PG2 Handheld Transmitter\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAudio Input Level\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t+2 dBV maximum at -10dB position\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t-8 dBV maximum at 0dB position\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGain Adjustment Range 10dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRF Transmitter Output 10 mW typical (dependent on applicable country regulations)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions 223.52 mm L x 53.34 mm Dia.

It’s naïve to think that products and their sounds exist in a vacuum, with no relation to other, similar products. There’s always something else vying for the buyer’s attention, and these days the competition is fierce in almost every category of consumer electronics, and at all the popular price points. Therefore, one of the most relevant assessments a reviewer can make for a reader is where a product ranks among its peers in the overall marketplace. This gives potential buyers an informed overview that they can use to help make wise buying decisions.\n\t\n\t\tFor example, if you were to walk into a showroom and hear, see, and feel the Sonus Faber Venere 3.0, you might not guess their cost right off, particularly if you have any experience with high-end audio and know how absurdly high the prices can be. You might be surprised that the Venere 3.0 retails for $3498 USD per pair -- surprised by how little that is compared with how much it buys.\n\t\n\t\tOne of the most interesting tests of the cost of a new product is the general public -- not just the subset of buyers who might be interested in that particular product. We’ve all had friends who gasp when we tell them how much our new preamp cost. Conversely, folks who have visited my home while the Venere 3.0s were playing have been quite accepting when told the retail price of the speakers -- a semi-remarkable feat for a high-end brand. Let’s face it: most of the high end makes no sense to the average guy.\n\t\n\t\tDesign\n\t\n\t\tThe 3.0 floorstanding loudspeaker is the largest model in Sonus Faber’s Venere line, which includes four other models: the 1.5 and 2.0 stand-mounts ($1198 and $1698/pair, respectively), the 2.5 floorstander ($2498/pair), and the Center ($798 each) and Wall ($698 each). These prices are for the standard finishes of Gloss Black or White Lacquer; the Venere 3.0 is also available in Walnut veneer for a reasonable upcharge of $500/pair.\n\t\n\t\tThe Veneres represent Sonus Faber’s newest line and are their lowest-cost loudspeakers yet -- their price points were determined by designing the speakers in Italy but having them manufactured in China. One of the keys to the successful manufacture of speakers in China, I’m told, is how closely the contracting company monitors quality control on the production line. Companies that take care here can be rewarded with a finished product whose value far exceeds its retail cost. On the other hand, if quality control is all over the map or, worse, nonexistent, the reject rate, as well as poorly made and finished products reaching consumers’ hands, can be a disaster, financially and from a branding standpoint.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Venere 3.0 is a three-way, four-driver design measuring 45.6\"H x 13.4\"W x 17.3\"D and weighing 47 pounds. Each driver is mounted in an asymmetrical waveguide; starting from the top, they are: a 1” silk-dome tweeter, which at 2300Hz hands off to a 6” midrange cone directly below it, which in turn is crossed over to two 7” woofers at 220Hz. The Venere 3.0’s crossovers are said to comprise a combination of first- and third-order slopes.\n\t\n\t\tThe midrange and woofer cones look from afar to be carbon fiber, but Sonus Faber says they’re made of Curv, a thermo-molded polypropylene textile woven much as carbon fiber would be. The cones’ dustcaps are made of coated paper, however -- an interesting combination of materials that Sonus Faber states adds naturalness to the sound. The Venere drivers’ parts are sourced from outside vendors (the tweeter’s diaphragm, for instance, comes from German firm Dr. Kurt Müller GmbH & Co., aka DKM) and are assembled by others, too, but they aren’t picked out of catalogs -- you won’t see these drive-units in speakers from any other manufacturer.\n\t\n\t\tThe Venere 3.0’s specifications include a sensitivity of 90dB SPL (2.83V/m), a nominal impedance of 6 ohms, a frequency response of 38Hz-25kHz, and maximum power handling of 300W, though Sonus Faber also states that the 3.0 can be driven by as little as 40W. The cabinet’s lyre-shaped cross section is preferred by Sonus Faber for its lack of parallel surfaces, which strengthens the walls and reduces the formation of standing waves. On the front is a flat-black front baffle; above it is a smoked-glass insert forming the top panel, below it a glass base on which the cabinet rests. The base screws directly into the bottom of the cabinet with wood screws (a step completed by the purchaser) instead of machine screws and accompanying steel inserts -- just about the only clue of the sort of trade-offs that had to be made to keep the 3.0’s cost down.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe speaker’s vent is at the bottom of the front baffle. On the narrow rear panel (a strip, really) are two pairs of sturdy five-way binding posts, connected with a metal jumper that can be removed for biwiring or biamping. Beefy spikes fit into the glass base and tilt the speaker back slightly, to attain the optimal firing axes. Grillecloths attach to the front baffle via magnets.\n\t\n\t\tThe overall fit’n’finish of the Venere 3.0 is remarkable for the price. My samples, in White Lacquer, looked modern and crisp, and the combination of materials and colors made for an attractive speaker that I can imagine working well with almost any room and décor. I saw no orange peel in the finish, nor could I find any flaws other than a few scratches on the spikes. I give the Venere 3.0 a solid “A” in terms of looks, build, and packaging.\n\t\n\t\tSound\n\t\n\t\tI was hoping that, with the Veneres, Sonus Faber had not produced a line of speakers with syrupy, overwarm sound. I could see them doing that, in an attempt to hark back to the days when that type of sound was described as “romantic” and “inviting,” but that these days comes off as boring and nondescript. The Venere 3.0 was not problematic in that way. In fact, to my ears, its sound seemed quite straightforward. Right off, I heard a substantially neutral tonal character that was presented in a seamless fashion that indicated good integration of the drivers’ outputs.\n\t\n\t\tBeginning with the vocal range: the midband didn’t leave me wanting more tonal density. Recordings with prominent male and female voices were brought to the fore by the Venere 3.0s with effortless clarity. I listened to Andrea Bocelli sing Mascagni’s “Sancta Maria,” from the tenor’s Sacred Arias (16-bit/44.1kHz AIFF, Philips), and was impressed by how the Veneres projected his voice cleanly into the room, with clear intelligibility and smooth sound. With this track I’ve noticed that a speaker that’s reticent in the midrange will miniaturize Bocelli’s voice. The Sonus Fabers most certainly did not do that. In fact, when I switched to Enya’s “One Toy Soldier,” from her And Winter Came (16/44.1 AIFF, Reprise), her voice popped right out of the large electronically contrived soundstage. But what were most impressive with this track were the tick-tocks in the opening moments, which serve to establish the rhythm. These were snappy and crisp, sounding present in my room, with enough definition in the leading edges to make them believable. The Venere 3.0s were very good at keeping all the musical elements of this and other tracks separate and distinct, their four drivers delivering big-speaker soundstaging from a moderately sized floorstander.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tWhich brings me to my next observation. The 3.0 is the top of the Venere line, and I believe Sonus Faber wanted this model to “bring it” when asked to do so. These speakers could produce sizable scale and substantial energy -- “Emmanuel,” from the Enya album, sounded majestic, swelling to reproduce an immense soundscape in my room. Enya’s voice was clear and distinct at all times, while the chorus came in to create a convincingly atmospheric soundstage of impressive height and depth.\n\t\n\t\tI’ve heard smallish floorstanders that sounded like large bookshelf speakers. These types of designs -- perhaps due to budget-constrained drivers -- always leave me with the feeling that I need to push the speaker a little harder than normal in order to get the exact sound I want out of them. In other words, they can sound as if they’re being held back by something. Mind you, the sounds of such speakers can be pleasant; they’re just not ultimately satisfying. The Sonus Faber Venere 3.0 went a long way toward ameliorating that problem in speakers costing under $4000/pair. I felt that, when I goosed the volume, the Venere 3.0s responded by effortlessly scaling properly with whatever music I was playing.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tWhen I decided to have Slacker Radio playing in the background, the Venere never gratuitously exposed the limited resolution of this sort of source. I listened to Ellie Goulding’s Lights (Slacker, Polydor), cranked the volume to 11, and plopped myself down in my listening seat. The beat was driving hard, and the peaks reached 95dB in my room, per my iPhone SPL meter. What this tells me is that the Venere 3.0 is a very “livable” speaker -- one you can listen to with recordings and sources of various qualities at a wide range of volume levels, without worrying about damaging the speakers or your ears. This is a very good attribute for a speaker that’s priced within reach of many Apple-buying consumers.\n\t\n\t\tVenere 3.0 frequency response at the listening position in the Music Vault\n\t\n\t\tWhen I moved back to the other end of the recording-quality scale -- Jerry Junkin conducting the Dallas Wind Symphony, with organist Mary Preston, in Sir William Walton’s Crown Imperial (24/176.4 WAV, Reference Recordings) -- I could immediately appreciate the resolution that the Sonus Fabers let through. Highs were very detailed, if not ultra-airy, and the midrange was crisp. Granted, the low-frequency foundation wasn’t as firm or as deep as I’ve heard from some much larger speakers with this track -- the sound of the pipe organ was not as grand or as room filling. After all, low bass is where the reality of two bass drivers measuring only 7” surfaces. They just aren’t going to play as loud or as low as a properly loaded set of 10” cones or a single 12” cone. Still, the bass the Venere 3.0s did produce was tighter than I’d expected, with good physical impact when the music called for it. Donald Fagen’s Morph the Cat (16/44.1 AIFF, Reprise) energized my room and gave me a satisfying sense of weight -- just what’s needed to make this song enjoyable.\n\t\n\t\tConsiderations and conclusions\n\t\n\t\tIf, as we’ve heard so many times before, loudspeaker design is a balance of trade-offs, then Sonus Faber’s Venere 3.0 is perhaps the most balanced design you can buy for anywhere near $3500/pair. It’s the speaker no one thought Sonus Faber could or would produce, and they’ve pulled it off: It can play large and loud, it can render recordings of both high and low resolution in enjoyable fashion, its substantially neutral tonal character won’t distract you with speaker colorations, and it can do all of this while looking spectacular. In this respect, it’s an easy recommendation for listeners both serious and casual. It might not be as revealing as, say, KEF’s R900, a model popular among SoundStage! Network reviewers (Roger Kanno and Hans Wetzel each own a set), but the Venere 3.0 costs $1500/pair less than the R900, and has one up on the KEF in terms of appearance -- the R900 looks boxy by comparison.\n\t\n\t\tAlthough I know that designers can be tempted to optimize one or two aspects of sound quality in order to give a speaker’s sound something “special” that the listener can latch on to, Sonus Faber has avoided that trap. With the Venere 3.0, no single aspect of sonic reproduction sticks out, and the result is a balanced sound that will appeal to average folk as well as to the audiophile.\n\t\n\t\tAt the end of the day, the Sonus Faber Venere 3.0 is the speaker I would unhesitatingly recommend to any friend shopping for a pair of speakers costing up to $4500/pair. While there’s stiff competition above that -- the aforementioned KEF R900, PSB’s Synchrony One, the Paradigm Tribute -- I can’t think of any other speaker I’d rather own at the price. But even if you’ve budgeted $4500 to $6000, the Venere 3.0 should be in your short list of speakers to hear\n\t\n\t\tI imagine box after box of Veneres, stretching almost as far as the mind’s eye can see, ready to ship to waiting customers. This speaker is a big deal for Sonus Faber, and for the high-end community at large.\n\t\n\t\tAssociated Equipment\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAmplifiers -- Ayre Acoustics MX-R monos\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPreamplifier -- Ayre Acoustics KX-R\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSources -- Apple MacBook running OS X Snow Leopard, iTunes, Amarra, Audirvana; Calyx Audio Femto DAC\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCables -- Nordost Valhalla, AudioQuest Niagara interconnects; Nordost Valhalla, AudioQuest Meteor speaker cables; AudioQuest Carbon USB cable; Nordost Valhalla power cords\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1399/1/VENERE3.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1399/2/Sonus-Faber-Venere-3.0-Speakers-1.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1399/3/veneres3.02222.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1399/4/Venere_3_black.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1310","curve":"Sonus Faber Venere S Black","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=promo","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1310/1/UntitledFaberBlack-1.jpg","curve2":" Sonus faber\n\n\nSonus faber is today part of the product portfolio of Fine Sounds Group, the holding company of the brands Audio Research, leader in the production and sales of audio electronic components High-Definition Vacuum-Tubes (valves) and Solid State, Wadia Digital, one of the first companies dedicated to high-performance digital audio playback, which has been at the forefront in technology for Apple iPod and iPhone docking stations, Sumiko, importer and distributor of the best audio components in North America; Fine Sounds Group has recently purchased McIntosh Laboratory, the most important American producer of high fidelity systems, world leader in prestigious home entertainment systems and for over 60 years in highest quality audio systems.\n\n\nWith these important acquisitions, result of the entrepreneurial project of Mauro Grange (CEO of Sonus faber and Fine Sounds Group), Sonus faber together with its American 'sisters' makes up one of the world's largest groups in the High-End sector, , namely the market of the most sophisticated and prestigious acoustic speakers and audio electronics in the world\n\nThe recent acquisition of McIntosh, based in Binghamton - NY, is for End Sounds a \"marquee investment\" whose strategic objective is to offer products that are the best in the world in their category.

Introducing the PB16-Ultra.\n\n\tAn unrelenting passion for breathtaking bass performance and engineering perfection guided every aspect of the PB16-Ultra subwoofer’s development. Groundbreaking technology, rigorous design and extreme testing in real world and laboratory environments allowed SVS to achieve unmatched low frequency extension and output capabilities all while keeping it amazingly detailed and articulate. The culmination of all SVS design advancements, PB16-Ultra represents an incomparable bass experience. Nothing else comes close.\n\n\tMasterful Engineering. 3 Game-Changing Subwoofer Innovations.\n\n\tOne of these groundbreaking innovations would’ve been enough to make the PB16-Ultra an engineering tour-de-force, but the combination of 3 subwoofer firsts propels the SVS PB16-Ultra into the pantheon of all-time great audio products.\n\n\t\n\n\tMassive New 16-inch SVS Ultra Driver with Unprecedented 8-inch Edge Wound Voice Coil.\n\n\t\n\n\tWhen designing the biggest and most formidable driver ever used in an SVS subwoofer, it was of utmost importance to meet or exceed the same supreme standards of control and accuracy as every other subwoofer SVS manufactures. One huge advancement that allows the PB16-Ultra to handle the crushing force of a 16-inch driver is the 8-inch edge wound voice coil, the largest ever deployed in a consumer subwoofer. This innovation ensures ultra-low distortion and pinpoint control at the highest drive levels resulting in incredible output and low frequency extension. By nature, larger drivers are more difficult to control, but the unprecedented voice coil design ensures accuracy in frequency response and speed in transients without ever sounding boomy.\n\n\tPushing the driver are four massive, dedicated toroidal ferrite magnets that unleash a staggering 95mm peak to peak excursion and the highest levels of motor force and palpable SPLs. The light and rigid 16-inch Ultra driver cone consists of a premium fiberglass resin composite with optimal stiffness to mass ratio to maximize movement of air and sonic energy without ever distorting or losing control.\n\n\tStunningly Powerful, New Sledge Amplifier with Fully Discrete MOSFET Output and 1,500 Watts Continuous, 5,000+ Watts Peak Power.\n\n\tConservatively rated at 1,500 watts continuous, 5,000+ watts peak power, the PB16-Ultra Sledge STA-1500D amplifier’s 64 Amp 200-Volt MOSFETs are the sonic muscle behind arguably the most powerful and highest fidelity subwoofer amplifier ever developed. Discrete MOSFET output unbridles the nearly limitless power in the Sledge amplifier and pushes the 16-inch driver to extreme levels of performance. They also represent an upgrade over the less robust integrated circuit output stages found in nearly all other Class D subwoofer amplifiers.\n\n\tEffortless power must be harnessed to ensure refined behavior and pristine output at the most demanding drive levels. To achieve this, the PB16-Ultra subwoofer uses the audio industry’s most advanced 50 MHz Analog Devices Audio DSP with 56bit filtering to handle the nearly limitless power, only unleashing the perfect amount of low frequency energy at just the right time.\n\n\tInnovative New Smartphone App for Subwoofer DSP and Control.\n\n\t\n\n\tCompatible with Apple® and Android® platforms, the innovative PB16-Ultra smartphone app unleashes the full depth, force and nuance of the world’s finest subwoofer. The groundbreaking SVS subwoofer app controls all DSP functions and conveniently stores custom presets. It’s the easiest way ever to fine tune bass surpassing 16Hz at reference volumes from the comfort of your favorite seat.\n\n\tFor added convenience, 2-way feedback shows updates in real time on both the app and subwoofer interface and Bluetooth connectivity allows adjustments to be made even when the subwoofer is not in sight. Control is also available via IR remote and an intuitive front panel display.\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t Quick Specs\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDriver | 16\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAmplifier | 1500 watts RMS (5000+ watts peak)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFreq.

On the accasion of the 25th anniversary of the birth of Unison Research, we pay homeage to these historic devices by offering the Simply Two and the Absolute in a limited and numbered \"Anniversary\" Edition. Wwe/ve also decided to offer a completely new version of the Triode 20 and named it, quite approriately, the Triode 25.\n\t\n\tThe Triode 25, like its predecessor, is a push-pul amplifier that utilizes EL34 tubes in the output stage. The push-pull circuit includes a final stage with two power tubes intended for the amplification of the positive half-waves, respectively, and of the negative hald-waves of the audio signal. The task properly recontructing the audio signal is then assigned to the output transformer which, thanks to its symmetrical structure, allows for a highly linear signal. Here are some of the more important and significant benefits of a oush-pull structure in this type of amplifier design.\n\t- Higher output power\n\t- Higher efficiency and therefore less heat generated, with positive effects on the durability of the output tubes as well as a significant savings in energy costs\n\t- No static polarization of the output transformer, resulting in better performance of this section\n\tTo ensure high quality sound in an amplifier with a push-pull configuration, however, it is essential that all individual ampplification stage, especially the two semi-output amplifier, are carefully designed and contructed to prevent the formation of dangeroud and compromising odd-order harmonic distortion. This is even true for the output transformer.\n\tThe new Triode amplifier 25 has experienced a long and painstaking design and testing period despite the considerable experience already gained in the contruction of its predecessor, the Triode 20. The Triode 25 can operate in two modes: triode and pentode. The latter is capable of delivering power output of over 45 watts per channel with a load of 6 ohms with harmonic distortion extremely contained across the entire audio band.\n\t\n\tSPECIFICATIONS:\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOutput Stage\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPush-pull, ultralinear, Class-AB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOutput Power\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tApprox. 45 watt per channel\n\t\t\t\tPentode configuration Approx \n\t\t\t\t25 Watt per channel Triode\n\t\t\t\tConfiguration\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOutput Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t6 Ohm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t47k Ohm/50pF\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNegative feedback\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t5 dB or 1.8dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tValve complement\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t2 x ECC83 (12AX7) 1 x ECC82 (12AU7)\n\t\t\t\t4 x EK34 (6CA7)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPower Consumption\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t300 watt max\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFuses\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tT6.3A from 100V to 130V T3.15A from 220V\n\t\t\t\tto 250V\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDimension \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t30 cm x 45 cm x 20 cm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNet Weight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t22KG\n\t\t\n\t\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2107/1/TRIODE25.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2107/2/triode25newclass_4_.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2107/3/TRIODE25_001.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2107/4/TRIODE25_C.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=731","curve":"Unison Research Unico CD Primo","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/731/1/cdprimo.jpg","curve2":"Unico CD Primo","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 26.900.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=731","Title":"Unison Research Unico CD Primo","Text":"\n\tEach product Unison Research designs and builds is the sum of our long experience in high-quality audio, coupled with our passion and commitment to providing music lovers with the opportunity to experience wonderful sound.

In the inner structure, however the “new” one differentiates itself basically from its predecessor.Thus a Sanyo drive ensures a clean and improved scanning of your CDs. The Sanyou Chip DA11 ensures the reading of the data; the software belonging to it has been developed by us.\n\t\t\n\t\tThe PCM1796 of the trademark Burr-Brown functions as D/A-converter. The result:clear better soundwith even clear better dynamics as well as improved decoder-precision (24bit, 192 kHz).\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe analogous signal will be processed in a fully balanced manner. All the 4 signal linesare provided with their own filter and own amplifier unit. This improves the sound clarityand increases the dynamic range.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe CD-S7 would not be located in the tubeLine,when no tubes would be used. Thus we now use 2 tubes of the type 12AX7 in the si-gnaling pathway. The sound will become warmer and silkier through this; however it willnot have a washed out effect or display any obscurities in the sound. No, transparencyand spatiality will be clear after the first sounds.We have also took a look on the supply of power and voltage and made improvementsagain. A new oversized toroidal transformer always provides sufficient services, and a6Z4 tube ensures the stability in the voltage.Components of well-known manufacturers, gold-plated tube sockets and gold-platedconnections round off the overall picture of the CD-S7.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tTechnical Details\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tD/A Converter: 24 bit/192 kHz\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequency Response: 20 Hz - 20 KHz\n\t\t\t\t\tDistortion: < 0.005 %\n\t\t\t\t\tSignal to Noise ratio: > 94 dB\n\t\t\t\t\tDynamic Range: > 100 dB\n\t\t\t\t\tOutput Voltage: 2,5 V\n\t\t\t\t\tChannel Separation: > 90 dB\n\t\t\t\t\tInputs: 1 x Headphone jack 6,3 mm, 1 x 12 V Trigger in\n\t\t\t\t\tOutputs: 1 x RCA (Stereo), 1 x Coaxial, 1 x 12 V Trigger out\n\t\t\t\t\tTubes: 12AX7B, 1 x 6Z4\n\t\t\t\t\tColor: Black or silver\n\t\t\t\t\tWeight: 9 kg\n\t\t\t\t\tDimensions: 430 x 356 x 132 mm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/622/1/CDS-7DAC.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/622/2/vincent-cd-s7-innenleben-600x508.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/622/3/vincent-cd-s7-back.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/622/4/vincent-cd-s7-dalkove-ovladani.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=684","curve":"Vincent CD-S8","curve_URL1":"","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/684/1/url.jpg","curve2":"Symmetrically constructed HDCD player\n\nThe CD-S8: A Class On Its Own!\n\nIn this product line all was achieved that stands for the Vincent philosophy: listening to music, not matter at which volume level.","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 44.880.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=684","Title":"","Text":"\n\t\n\t\tCD-S8\n\t\n\t\tSymmetrically constructed HDCD player\n\n\n\tThe CD-S8: A Class On Its Own!\n\n\tIn this product line all was achieved that stands for the Vincent philosophy: listening to music, not matter at which volume level.\n\n\t \n\n\tPleasure, not matter at which volume level.\n\tThe CD player CD-S8 captivates with its music playback without neglecting the details.

I had to remind myself of the cost of this phono stage… I genuinely struggle to think of a phono stage below £1000 which will best this unit…\"\n\n\tVincent's Best Compact Preamp to Date\n\n\tFor more than ten years, Vincent Audio has been successfully designing and manufacturing phono preamplifiers. The new PHO-700 may be the German company's best compact preamp to date. Often overlooked in the digital era, vinyl has recently been experiencing a dramatic comeback. The preamp is a necessary component, which allows you to connect your turntable to receivers, amplifiers, and other gear that lack a dedicated phono input.\n\n\tIn a record player, the output signal is at amuch lower level than the signal from a line stage component, such as a CD player. So the challenge in building a great sounding phono stage is to provide a low-noise and loss-free transmission. Vincent met that challenge and exceeds expectations with the PHO-700.\n\n\tHighly Regulated Separate-chassis Power Supply\n\n\tVincent has deliberately omitted the typical 'wall-art' AC power adapter, opting for a specially designed and highly developed outboard power supply instead. Feeling is believing. The power unit has impressive heft when held in the hand and testifies to the quality of the transformer, metal chassis, shielding, and other components.\n\n\tThis no-compromise approach to power helps the PHO-700 to achieve its low-noise performance. The PHO-700 uses the same power supply that is already employed to great advantage in Vincent's critically acclaimed PHO-8 phono preamplifier. It is connected to the separate-chassis audio circuitry using a nine-pin DIN cable. The voltage is highly regulated and filtered, so that the ripple and hum found in unconditioned AC power right out of the wall will not reach the phono section. The delicate audio circuitry only receives clean power.\n\n\tVacuum Tube Circuitry for Smooth, True-to-Life Sound\n\n\tThe PHO-700 delivers the luxurious sound that can only be obtained with finely-made vacuum tube equipment as well as the power associated with solid state designs, including speed, reliability, and control. That's a difficult combination to beat, especially once you factor in the affordable price.\n\n\tLook inside the front panel 'window' of the PHO-700 and you'll see a 12AU7 vacuum tube used in dual triode mode. This contributes to the warm, true-to-life sound. High-quality components from Nichicon, Wima, and other companies improve the parameters of noise ratio and amplification.\n\n\tFeatures\n\n\t\n\t\tTwo-chassis MM/MC phono stage\n\t\n\t\tHybrid tube/solid state design\n\t\n\t\tHighly regulated power supply in separate chassis\n\t\n\t\t12AU7 vacuum tube\n\t\n\t\tHigh-precision RIAA correction\n\t\n\t\tInputs: 1x RCA stereo, 1x DIN (DC IN PHO-700)\n\t\n\t\tOutputs: 1x RCA stereo, 1x DIN (DC OUT PHO-700ps)\n\t\n\t\tColor front plate: black / silver\n\n\n\tSpecifikasi\n\n\t\n\t\tRIAA tolerance/deviation: 10 Hz - 20 kHz (max. 0.5dB)\n\t\n\t\tOutput Impedance: 250 ohms\n\t\n\t\tInput Sensitivity (MM): 58 mV\n\t\n\t\tInput Sensitivity (MC): 6.8 mV\n\t\n\t\tInput Impedance (MM): 47 k ohms\n\t\n\t\tInput Impedance (MC): 100 ohms\n\t\n\t\tDistortion: < 0.05%\n\t\n\t\tSignal-Noise-Ratio: MM > 81 dB; MC > 69 dB\n\t\n\t\tDimensions (W x H x D): 130 x 82 x 225 mm (2x)\n\t\n\t\tWeight: 1.5 kg (PHO-700ps), 1.2 kg (PHO-700)\n\n","Price":"Rp 10.500.000,-","Discounted_Price":"Rp 8.925.000,-","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1123/1/VincentPHO700111.JPG","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1123/2/VincentPHO700.1.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1123/3/VincentPHO700.2.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1123/4/VincentPHO700.3.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1835","curve":"Vincent SA 32 / Vincent SA-32 ","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1835/1/sa32-1.jpg","curve2":"The further development of our hybrid preamplifier SA-31.

The new FET mains connector ensures high signal noise distance in this end stage, very little distortion and a clear and open sound.\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTechnical details\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequency response: 10 Hz - 50 kHz +/- 0.5 dB,\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNominal Output Power RMS/8 Ohm: 200W,\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNominal Output Power RMS/4 Ohm: 320W\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClass A/8 Ohm: 20W, Total harmonic distortion: < 0.1 % (1 kHz, 1 Watt),\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInput sensitivity: 1,1V, Signal-Noise ratio: > 90 dB\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInput impedance: 47 kOhm, Inputs: 1 x RCA, 1 x XLR\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOutputs: 2 x 2 Speaker Terminal (A & B), Mains supply: 230 V/50 Hz\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tColour: black/silver, Weight: 18 kg, Dim.

The SV-226 MK II deftly defies that expectation; it melds the sweetness of tubes with the power and control of transistors. For this kind of money that’s nothing short of phenomenal.”\n\tSteve Guttenberg, AVguide.com\n\n\t \n\n\tDesigned in Germany and hand-built in China, the Vincent SV-226 Mk II is a really big amplifier. There’s a retro quality to its machined metal faceplate and knobs, which feel great, by the way. And while it may not be obvious when you first look at it, the SV-226 Mk II is a hybrid, tube/solid state design. It uses three 6N4 tubes (equivalent to the more common 12AX7 tube) in the preamp section and highly regarded Toshiba power transistors in the amp. Vincent’s parts quality selection seems first rate; for example, the amp uses expensive capacitors and extremely precise metal film resistors in the signal path.\n\n\tThe power transformer is huge and the power supply is considerably beefier than what you’ll find in most affordable integrated amps, which is why the SV-226 MK II doubles its 8 ohm rated power of 100 watts to 200 watts into 4-ohm speakers. The heavy-duty speaker connectors can accommodate burly audiophile cables, no problem.\n\n\tThe bass and treble controls (which are defeatable) and it also includes a Loudness button! Activate the loudness control for hushed late-night listening sessions and it’ll boost both bass and treble; it really does work like a charm.\n\n\tThe all-metal remote is beautifully machined and designed with the cover is held in place with powerful magnets.\n\n\tTip: The SV-226 Mk II has enough current and power to drive pretty much any speaker upto about $5000.\n\n\tIn The News\n\n\tSteve Guttenberg from The Absolute Sound writes: \"I’ve listened to a lot of hybrid amplifiers in my time, but the truth of the matter is they almost always sound like solid-state amps. The SV-226 Mk II deftly defies that expectation; it melds the sweetness of tubes with the control and power of transistors. For this kind of money that’s nothing short of phenomenal.\n\n\tThrough the Vincent, the White Stripes’ thick, muscular rock comes on like gangbusters. The SV-226 Mk II’s low end is airy and wonderfully nimble, light on its feet, yet plumbs the depths of the bass. There’s no “tubey” mellifluousness down there, thank you very much! Next I popped on Neil Young & Crazy Horse Live at the Fillmore East 24/96 DVD-Audio [Reprise] and I’m here to tell you this is one of those discs that just sounds better and better the louder I play it. The SV-226 Mk II was happy driving my Dynaudio speakers to room-filling volumes without complaint or undue duress.\n\n\tBob Belden’s jazz epic, Black Dahlia [Blue Note SACD] is an amazing piece of work. The mood shifts from track to track, ranging from a steamy Los Angeles landscape, to slinky nightlife, lost love, and a disturbing murder scenario—all rendered in opulent detail. At one point a lone bongo, set against a curtain of harps was so perfectly delineated that it took on a three-dimensional presence on the left side of my room. Dahlia is eerily cinematic in its sweep, and the SV-226 Mk II brought every luscious bit of it home to me.\"\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\tSpecifications:\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFrequency response: 5 Hz - 50 kHz +/- 1 dB\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNominal Output Power RMS/8 Ohm: 2x 100W\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNominal Output Power RMS/4 Ohm: 2x 200W\n\n\n\t\n\t\tInput sensitivity: 180mV\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSignal-Noise ratio: > 90 dB, THD: < 0.1 % (1 kHz, 1 Watt)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tInput impedance: 47 kOhm, Inputs: 6 x RCA\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOutputs: 4 x 2 Speaker Terminal (A & B), 1 x RCA Rec Out, 1 x RCA Pre Out,\n\n\n\t\n\t\tOutputs: 1 x headphone jack 6.3 mm\n\n\n\t\n\t\tMains supply: 230 V/50 Hz\n\n\n\t\n\t\tColour: Black (Call to check availability of Silver)\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWeight: 20 kg.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDimensions (WxHxD): 430 x 150 x 435 mm\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTubes: 3 x 12AX7\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPower Control: 2 x 12V Trigger Out (3.5mm)\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/612/1/sv226mk.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/612/2/sv226-back.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/612/3/SV-226MK2_Innen.jpg","Image_URL_4":""},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1004","curve":"Vincent SV-226MKII (Black)","curve_URL1":"","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1004/1/vin.jpg","curve2":"Vincent SV-226MK-II is the latest incarnation of a series of amplifiers, which began with the highly successful Vincent SV-226.

In this way the SV-236MK developed. Based on the outstanding characteristics of SV-236 a unit was enhanced, which advanced in performance only by parts of the above-mentioned changes. The increase is around 50W, from 100W at 8 Ohm to 150W at 8 Ohm. As a result the listener enjoys clearly improved performance and dynamics, the sound simply gets even better, more superior. Even the power adaptor was revised and provides for sound improvement. The new voltage stabilization circuit is introduced in the \n\t SV-236MK. Consequently the sound has clearly improved, close to tube sound and thus much higher musicality. A further result is the simpler and improved circuit layout, the signals follow the simplest paths free of disturbances. Sound-defining parts were optimized and greatly improved. Generally it was reverted to proven components, where the signal could be affected relevantly. Thus for example German WIMA condensers are employed. All these changes are reflected in the exterior design and so even here changes were made. The casing was adjusted to the SV-234 casing, consequently the customer gets a clearly higher value and quality to the touch at first sight.\n\n\t \n\n\tTechnical details\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequency response:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t20 Hz - 50 kHz +/- 0.5 dB\n\t\t\t\t\t20 Hz - 50 kHz +/- 2.0 dB\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPower RMS/8 Ohm:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2x 150W\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPower RMS/4 Ohm:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2x 250W\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClass A/8 Ohm: \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2 x 10W\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tT.

These inputs are more suitable for daily use and offer more possibilities for connections. The unique circuit of Frank Blöhbum was not changed.\n\tUnder the leadership of Frank Blöhbaum, who is the developer of the Thorens electronics and the Auto-Bias control of the T.A.C. tube amplifiers, the circuit design was completely revised and improved. Thus, in the output stage section a phase reserve of 90 degree was reached by making various changes, This phase reserve provides  a much better transient response to complex loads (loudspeakers). Because the amplifier always works virutally during normal operation in state of the transient oscillation - Music represents transient pulses - the improvements can be heard elementary. Musicality and sound are much better than its predecessor. Even the most difficult loudspeakers can be powered easily. The amplifier always dominates the complex load (loudspeaker) without sounding strained.\n\tThe preamplifier section was fitted in the second stage with 6N1P tubes. The greater voltage level provides better signal stability, This results in a higher spectral purity of the signal which causes a further improvement in fine detail in the sound. Here, the tube-like greatly improved signal to noise raio. Its result in an excellent playback quality also on high efficiency speakers such as the Impulse series of Dynavox: Noise was once. Enjoy explosive live performance as a result of excellent dynamics. Moreover, the volume control has been finely adjusted. Thus, the volume level can be set precisely using remote control.\n\t\n\tTechnical Specifications:\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency Response\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t20Hz - 20kHz/-0.5dB, 20Hz-20kHz+/-2dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNominal Output Power RMS\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t8 Ohm: 2 x 150 Watt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNominal Output Power RMS\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t4 Ohm: 2 x 250 Watt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNominal Output Power Class A\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t8 Ohm: 2 x 10 Watt\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHarmonic Distortion\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<0.1% (1 kHz, 1 Watt)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Sensitivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t300mV\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSignal Noise Ratio\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t>90dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t47k Ohm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t4x Stereo RCA, 1x Optical, 1x Coaxial\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOutputs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1x Stereo RCA Ore Out, 1 x Stereo RCA Rec Out, \n\t\t\t\t4 x 2 Speaker Terminal, 2 x 3.5 mm Jack \n\t\t\t\t(Power Control)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTubes\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1 x 12A x 7; 2 x 6N1P-EV\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPlayable Formats\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWAV, FLAC, APEC, LPCM, MP3, ACC\n\t\t\t\tAC3, WMA\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tColour\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBlack\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWeight \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t23kg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDimension (WxHxD) in mm\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t430 x 152 x 435\n\t\t\n\t\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2106/1/SV-237MK.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2106/2/SV-237MK_Front_black.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2106/3/SV-237MK_Back_black.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2106/4/237.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1609","curve":"Vincent SV-700 Integrated Amplifier","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1609/1/SV700-1.jpg","curve2":"We decided on a consistent symmetrical design to minimize crossfeed and achieve a better distortion factor.

Strong, indestructible and vibrant in sound.\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTechnical details\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFrequency response: 20 Hz – 20 kHz +/-0.5dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNominal output power RMS/8 Ohm: 2 x 100W, RMS/4 Ohm: 2 x 160W\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRMS Class A / 8 Ohm: 2 x 50W\n\t\t\n\t\t\tHarmonic distortion: <0.1% (1 kHz, 1 W)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tInput sensitivity: 350mV\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSignal-noice ratio: >90dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOnput impedance: 47 kOhm\n\t\t\n\t\t\tInputs: 5 x Stereo RCA, 1 x Stereo XLR\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOutputs: 1 x Rec Stereo RCA, 2 x 2 speaker terminals\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2 x 3,5mm Jack sockets (Power Control)\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTubes: 4 x 12AX7, 4 x 12AU7\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeight: 26.5kg\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDimensions (WxHxD): 430x192x430mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\tColour: black / silver\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/683/1/800.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/683/2/VISV800_BLK_L-Large.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/683/3/VISV800_BLK_INT-Large.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/683/4/VISV800_BLK_R-Large.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1353","curve":"Wharfedale - Jade  C2 Black Oak (SALE 2020)","curve_URL1":"","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1353/1/UntitledJADEc2IIIIIII-1.jpg","curve2":"Wharfedale - Jade  C2 Black Oak","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 12.500.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=1353","Title":"","Text":"\n\tSpecification\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Description\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCentre channel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEnclosure Type\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3-way Aperiodic system\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDrive Units\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1 x 1\" (25mm) Alu high frequency dome\n\t\t\t\t1 x 3\" (76mm) Alu-pulp composite midrange cone\n\t\t\t\t4 x 5\" (125mm) Acufibre bass cone\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency Response\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t55Hz – 24kHz ±3dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSensitivity (2.83V @ 1M)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t88dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA/V shielded\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tYes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCrossover Frequency\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t240Hz, 810Hz, 3.3kHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNominal Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t6Ω\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRecommended amplifier power\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t50W - 200W\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDimensions (HxWxD)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t195mm x 914mm x 300mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNet weight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t18.6kg / pc\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAccessories\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRubber feet;

Whilst not the first stereo speakers to offer integrated amplification and Bluetooth connectivity with compatible devices including smartphones, tablets and computers, our clever ‘true wireless’ technology ensures greater flexibility than many such designs. This, combined with award-winning sonic know-how, delivers levels of convenience and performance that separate the Diamond Active Series from the rest of the wireless speaker crowd.\n\n\tWhat Models Are There?\n\n\tThe Diamond A2, is the larger floorstanding speaker in the series at 91.2cm high. The Diamond A1 is the smaller ‘bookshelf’-size speaker (31.5cm high) in the range. The Diamond A2 speakers are supplied in a pair with accompanying Diamond H1 Hub. Within each speaker is a 50W amplifier in each speaker to deliver a combined ‘system power’ of 100W.\n\n\tHow Do They Work?\n\n\tWharfedale’s Diamond Active Series speakers work differently to conventional wireless or powered speakers. They include an advanced wireless hub, to which the playback device is paired via Bluetooth (with support for the sonically superior aptX codec). The H1 hub then conveys the left and right audio signals to the appropriate speaker via uncompressed wireless transmission, allowing greater freedom in terms of positioning. As well as removing the need for the speakers to be connected together via a cable – that’s why we call it ‘true wireless’ – the fact that each speaker incorporates its own 50W amplifier helps to ensure consistent, fully optimised stereo sound.\n\n\tTo enable interference-free wireless transmission, the H1 hub avoids the often-crowded 2.4GHz frequency band, focusing on 5.8GHz instead. The intelligent wireless module has the ability to switch automatically between frequencies when required, thus avoiding any local interference wherever the speakers are sited. Each speaker may be placed up to 20m from the hub, giving exceptional positioning flexibility; the only other siting requirement is that both speakers, with their dedicated amplifiers, need to be plugged into the mains.\n\n\n\tDrivers\n\n\tThe Diamond A2 sports two proprietary 165mm bass/mid drivers, made with woven Kevlar – as featured in the Diamond 200 Series. The cone incorporate semi-elliptical ‘break-up’ areas, which smooth the response throughout the audible range, while rear-firing reflex ports augment the bass.\n\n\tThe 25mm fabric dome tweeter is also derived from the Diamond 200 Series, incorporating a precision-drive magnet system and a meticulously designed waveguide around the diaphragm for optimal dispersion. The drive units are combined via a sophisticated crossover network, specifically developed to optimise the performance of the Diamond Active speakers’ integrated amplifier/driver configuration, delivering a cohesive performance that is bold and engaging, yet also impressively refined.\n\n\tAll Diamond Active Models are available in a choice of Black Leatherette with High Gloss White or a High Gloss Black Front Baffle.\n\n\tSpecification\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDesign philosophy and core technology\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t5.8GHz True Wireless technology\n\t\t\t\t+/- 6dB Bass Control\n\t\t\t\tBalance Function\n\t\t\t\tMode selector: Left/Mono/Right\n\t\t\t\tDigital Amplifier with DSP\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDigital Input\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1 x Coaxial, 1 x Toslink Optical\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAnalog Input\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRCA x 2\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBluetooth Input\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\taptX (Priority), SBC\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInput sensitivity\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t350mV\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSignal frequencies\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t5.2/5.8GHz wireless uncompressed\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSampling rate for digital inputs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUp to 24bit / 96kHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWireless reception distance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t20m\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEnclosure type\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tbass reflex\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTransducer complement\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t2.5-way\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDrivers\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t165mm Woven Kevlar Woofer x 2 / 25mm Soft Dome Tweeter\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSystem power output\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t100W\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPeak SPL\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t96dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency response (+/-3dB)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t40Hz – 20KHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBass extension (-6dB)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t35Hz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCrossover frequency\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t2.8kHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSpeaker Finish\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBlack Leatherette with High Gloss White / Black Front Baffle\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHub Finish\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHigh Gloss Black with Touch Sensitive Display\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSpeaker Dimensions & Weight (each)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCabinet Volume\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t38L\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHeight (on feet)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(912+25)mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWidth\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t210mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDepth\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(300+10)mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNet Weight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t18.8 Kg\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHub Dimensions & Weight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHeight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t28.8mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWidth\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t150mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDepth\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t156mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNet weight\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t0.46kg\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1313/1/A2REVISIBELUMFINAL.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1313/2/w00102_20161014171025_1560WHARfedaleA2.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1313/3/w00102_20161014171029_1561WharfedaleA2.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1313/5/w00102_20161014171111_1571_1DiamondA2Active.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2502","curve":"Wharfedale Elysian 4 Premium Floorstanding Speaker","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=new","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2502/1/Elysian4PianoBlack.jpg","curve2":"Elysian 4\n\nA genuine example of luxury audio, ELYSIAN offers indulgence in design, materials aesthetic and performance.

The new Wharfedale LINTON further exemplifies these two edicts, balancing fine craftsmanship, natural sound quality and affordability inside a beautifully proportioned loudspeaker that has been bought in its millions right across the globe through it’s various incarnations.\n\nThe original LINTON was well known for its warm, rich and natural sounding character and the new Wharfedale LINTON retains that standing but imbues it with an open, detailed performance that will entice you to explore your whole music collection, once more.","curve3":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRp 19.500.000,-                                            \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                            ","curve_URL4":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2007","Title":"Wharfedale Linton Heritage Bookshelf Speaker with Original Stand","Text":"\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Description\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3-way vented-box/standmount\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEnclosure Type\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBass reflex\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTransducer Complement\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3-way\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBass Driver\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t8\"(200mm) black woven Kevlar® cone\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMidrange Driver\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t5\"(135mm) black woven Kevlar® cone\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTreble Driver\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t1\" (25mm) soft dome\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAV Shield\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNo\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSensitivity (2.83v @1m)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t90dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRecommended Amplifier Power\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t25-200W\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPeak SPL\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t110dB\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNominal Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t6Ω\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMinimum Impedance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t3.5Ω\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFrequency Response(+/-3dB)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t40Hz ~ 20kHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBass Extension(-6dB)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t35Hz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCrossover Frequency\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t630Hz & 2.4kHz\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHeight (on plinth)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t565mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWidth\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t300mm\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDepth (with terminals)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(330+30)mm\n\t\t\n\t\n\n","Price":"","Discounted_Price":"","Image_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2007/1/LINTONHERITAGE.jpg","Image_URL_2":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2007/2/LINTON-Heritage-right5c6edf83eca12.jpg","Image_URL_3":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2007/3/LINTON-Heritage-rear5c6edf82e28f5.jpg","Image_URL_4":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2007/4/41ix2y77VeL._SY355_.jpg"},{"curve_URL":"https://audiocentre.co.id/product.php?product=2398","curve":"Wharfedale SW12 SW 12 Powered Subwoofer 12 inch","curve_URL1":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/browse.php?status=hot","highslide_URL":"http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2398/1/SW12AC.jpg","curve2":"The SW series of subwoofers offer a level of performance previously unheard of in their class.

The AVENTAGE line of high-performance AV receivers is based on the audio design concept of providing a massive, full-bodied sound for movie sound effects and the accurate reproduction of music sources. By expertly harmonizing traditional and advanced technologies, every factor that affects sound quality, from materials and parts to construction, layout, vibration damping (unique foot) and “fine-tuning” the sound, is handled with no other thought than to achieve the best possible audio quality. As a result, every AVENTAGE model has the ability to reproduce the most subtle details of high-definition sound, so that listeners can enjoy a truly high-class sound studio experience at home.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAVENTAGE – Total Purity Concept\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEnjoy fine sound quality. The Total Purity Concept, which Yamaha has been cultivating for many years, encompasses high drive amp technology, high purity preamplification, anti-vibration technology and independent pure power supplies. All models have fully discrete power amplifiers that help minimize distortion. They also adopt pure independent power supplies, allowing dedicated power supplies for the analog and digital circuitry to prevent digital noise from affecting analog circuitry. The anti-vibration heat sinks are designed to suppress vibration from transistors and sound pressure. Independent power supplies for the DACs are designed to further eliminate noise on certain models. Down to every detail, these AV receivers are designed with full emphasis on the highest possible sound quality.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAVENTAGE – High Quality Parts\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe whole is greater than the sum. Every single part in an AV receiver affects the sound quality. For AVENTAGE models, extra time is taken to find (or develop) the exact parts needed to achieve the highest performance possible. Sound technicians go through a testing process to, in effect, \"tune\" the receiver's sound.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAVENTAGE – Anti-Resonance Technology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA firm foundation. The Anti-Resonance Technology Wedge is a fifth foot in the center of the unit. It dampens vibrations from the power transformer, power transistors and heat sinks, as well as vibrations that might be caused by the sound from the speakers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAVENTAGE – Advanced Foundational Design\n\t\t\n\t\t\tA foot fetish. The feet of the receiver feature a newly designed, high-density structure which utilizes two different kinds of interior ribs — straight and curved — to enhance strength and damping performance. Installation stability is improved and chassis resonance is dispersed, effectively eliminating external vibration. The low-range response is enhanced, while resonance peaks in the mid- and high-range are reduced, providing dynamic sound and accurate reproduction.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAVENTAGE – Aluminum Front Panel\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tShielded from noise.
