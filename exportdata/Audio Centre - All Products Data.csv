	Our most advanced cd, digital audio and network streaming player yet

	In a sense, digital audio doesn’t exist.

	You’d have to be a particularly dull superhero to possess ears that can decode the millions of 1’s and 0’s 

	that make up your CD collection or iTunes library. 

	Whatever the source – be it a laptop, CD player, smartphone, USB stick – the result is just a vibration in your speakers. 

	In other words, it all winds up analogue in the end.

	Arguably, when playing from a digital format, the most vital component is the DAC, or Digital to Analogue Converter. 

	We’ll spare you the bulk of the science, 

	but this is what translates that otherwise lifeless binary code into audible sound energy. 

	Bit-depth, meanwhile, is a key measure of audio quality.

	 

	So, if you’re listening to a 24-bit WAV copy of your favourite album through a DAC that only converts to 16-bit, 

	there’s a good chunk of detail going to waste right there. 

	That’s why we’ve included 32-bit DACs on the entire HDA range – the most commonly used bit-depth in digital recording – so you’re guaranteed the full aural picture of whatever the artist intended.

	In any amplifier, the signal path is at the mercy of anything that creates noise within the unit. Thus, we spare no expense in using only the most high-quality components, even if it means the cost of our power supplies overtaking that of everything else.

	The result, of course, is worth every penny.

	 

	A singer’s sharp intake of breath before hitting the chorus, a guitarist’s fingers sliding against the strings – it’s those seemingly minor details that can bring music to life. Fish out one of your all-time favourite albums and play it through a Bluetooth speaker, and guess what? Its sounds like a Bluetooth speaker. Play it through the SA10, and it’s as close to hearing the artist’s performance as you’re likely to get. There’s always joy in digging out an old recording you haven’t heard in years. With the HDA range, it’ll feel like hearing it forthe first time.

	There are two frequent problems with hi-fi amplifiers. Class A, the traditional audiophile’s choice, uses a single power supply constantly running at full capacity, even when there’s no signal coming through. Great for reproducing those subtle details at low levels however struggles to provide extreme power when needed.

	Class A/B, the most common amp class, switches between the two internal amplifiers, one for each half of the waveform. Far more efficient but often a recipe for crossover distortion, since those low-level details we crave can get lost within any mis-match between the two switching over.

	 

	Class G is essentially a hybrid amplifier, utilising Class A specifically for low-level signals, but when required switching in an additional power supply to power those larger sections of the waveform.

	VGP Japan (Visual Grand Prix) 2009

	Atlas products have a fast-growing reputation in Japan, this represents one of a series of recent rewards.

	 

	Product Information

	The Atlas Equator 2.0 provides for most system types. It is available as a 2 sq mm cable or a 3 sq mm cable or in the form of a bi-wire Equator cable using 2.sq mm for the bass and two conductors of 1.2 sq mm for the treble. Unlike it's less expensive siblings, the Equator series use a polypropylene dielectric thats far more efficient than PVC or polyethylene, and which gives greater signal velocity or speed thereby maintaining improved phase stability. The conductors are contained in a cotton yarn in order to reduce microphony and the outer sheath is in a tasteful pearl white finish.

	The Equator cables give an assured fatigue free performance with extended and sweet treble and a satisfying bass. Altogether these cables offer an effortless sound that provides a holographic sound stage with stereo width, height and depth that involve the listener. Buy the 2.0 sq mm for a good balanced system.

	Atlas has followed it's success in 2007's Awards with the Equator Mk11. We haven't come close to finding a pair of stereo interconnects that come close to offering the same kind of value. It's well-balanced, powerful sound is unbeatable at this price point.

	 

	The New Atlas Equator Integra recommended by HiFi Choice.

	In the October 2012 edition, HiFi Choice commented:

	And in the great scheme of interconnect(ed) things, the Equator III is very fine indeed – you’ll not find much at the price >that comes close in terms of musicality.

	 

	The New Atlas Equator Integra ticked all the boxes at What HiFi.

	In the January 2012 edition, What HiFi said:

	Working with the cable, our kit's performance gained additional dynamics and detailing within a spacious, well-timed and tonally neutral sound. In short, there's nothing to dislike here, if you want a fine second-upgrade interconnect, look no further than this Atlas.

	 

	Product Information

	Atlas Scotland understands the meaning of uncompromising performance. Is the ubiquitous Atlas Equator asymmetrical the best interconnect on the market? It sure is at it's price!

	The Atlas Equator Mk11 has been awarded the What Hi Fi best stereo interconnect of 2007 and 2008. In Mk1 form it was awarded the same accolade in 2002 and 2003.

	Following from our research and development programme, the Equator is fitted with our entirely new Integra plug. We were stunned when we first heard the improvement in sound quality we'd achieved with the new Atlas non magnetic plug.

	The plug benefits from a solder free, cold weld interface between the 99.9999% pure copper co-axial stranded conductors and the plug for both the going and return signals. being free of solder, another barrier to the free-flow of the signal has been removed.

	The Integra plug employs two conjugate brackets. These brackets grip the cable without compressing it. Compressing a coaxial causes the cable to alter its impedance from 75 Ohms thereby causing deletions. In a digital interface the impedance can drop to some 40 Ohms which causes reflections and jitter. The Integra plug lets more information through.

	The integra plug with conjugate brackets entirely rejects radio frequency interference all the way from the plug to conductor interface so there's less deletions or interference.

	The integra plug contains four asymmetrical sleeves that are sprung and which spread on insertion thereby cleaning the plug to socket interface every time the plug is inserted. It's easy to keep a clean signal path with the Atlas Integra plug, just remove it and re-insert it!

	The Integra plug uses a non magnetic ABS cover which may avoid a saturation in the return leg at an RCA plug's metal sheath if it's in the signal path. The integra sheath facilitates a direct barrier free return signal path with less interference.

	The Equator coaxial cable employs two woven screens for 100% coverage and the efficient rejection of radio frequency interference.

	Finally the Equator Integra is provided with a unique seriel number and a five year guarantee. Buyers may be confident they've purchased a genuine Atlas cable, researched, developed and produced in Scotland and made from the finest materials available.

	A consistent winner, the improved Equator Integra is obviously the entry level audio interconnect for discerning music lovers. Like all Atlas interconnects, it provides a huge sound-stage together with a smooth delivery. It avoids the over bright and irritating sound so often a feature of similarly priced interconnects. Rather in common with all Atlas interconnects, irrespective of price, it offers the listener a sophisticated and relaxing sound with no artificial highs or lows.

	You'll get more from an Atlas Equator Integra. We hope like we were, when you hear the improvement in quality you too will be stunned. Visit an Atlas stockist today, and try the Equator Integra and enjoy the sophisticated and revealing broad band sound. Other cables can skew sound quality into a high frequency bias in order to initially impress the listener. That sound can cause fatigue, an Atlas sound will never irritate or cause fatigue. It will give the listener many hours of relaxed pleasure, isn't that what HiFi is for?

	Put your trust in the Atlas Equator Integra.

	The Atlas Hyper cables offer unbeatable value. The Hyper 2.0 is the cable that compliments and lifts most HiFi systems by introducing a sound quality that's superior in it's definition and quality. Previously unheard of at the prices of these cables of is a PTFE dielectric and 6N pure (99.9999%) OFC conductors. Indeed the Hyper is almost certainly one of the finest Hi Fi performance bargains today.

	The Hyper cables are available in 1.5sq mm, 2.0 sq mm, 3.0 sq mm and Bi-Wire options. Choose the 1.5 where bass isn't a priority or for rear speakers in a 5.1 system for example. Choose the Hyper 2.0 or 3.0 for increased bass and the Bi-Wire for improved high frequency information in a bi-wire speaker system.

	The Atlas Hyper cables share many similarities with the more advanced Ascent models. The Hyper cables are smooth and refined allowing for continuous listening over a prolonged period without causing listener fatigue.

	We sincerely recommend these are used in conjunction with the range of Hyper interconnects. The Asymmetrical will offer excellent clarity with definition; great  for modern music. The Hyper Symmetrical offers a more sophisticated and relaxing analogue-like presentation with extra width, depth  and height. The fully balanced Atlas Hyper Symmetrical with Atlas XLR plugs, should be used in a balanced system for optimum noise free results. All the Hyper speaker cables offer superb fidelity, however for the best results, the interconnects and the speaker cables were designed to match. If an interconnect is used that cannot feed throught to the speaker via the speaker cables, a complete signal, then it matters not how good the speakers or the speaker cables may be, they cannot recover information lost by an interconnect. 

	Note: the biggest complaint we hear from people calling our help line, is that their system sounds bright and they find it irritating. The cables they've been sold are usually silver plated cables. We don't try to skew the sound into a high frequency bias in order to impress by using silver plated conductors; good high frequency information is provided by improved VOP (velocity of propagation) and quality dielectrics. These can't be done on the cheap and we won't compromise our principals by selling something we don't feel is appropriate or with which we don't feel comfortable.

	AWG equivalence table.

	Complementary products:

	Complementary products are the excellent Hyper Symmetrical interconnect fully balanced with Atlas solder free XLR plugs, the Symmetrical pseudo balanced Hyper interconnect with Atlas conjugate bracket RCA plugs, the Hyper digital interconnect, the Hyper 1.5 and 3.0 speaker cable and Hyper Bi Wire speaker cable all with Atlas solder free Z Plugs or OFC spades

	Recommended accessories:

	Recommended accessories for even better results, are the Atlas Eos power cables and the Atlas Eos balanced power supply.

	Removal of the brass links between HF and LF terminals typically provided on speakers, and their replacement with better quality Atlas links will also contribute to much improved sound and listening pleasure.

	THE SOUND OF SCIENCE
	The 6000CDT is the lates CD transport from audiolab. Using audiolab's slot loading mechanism, the transport uses read-ahead digital buffering to reduce disc reading failures and delive the highest level of digital signal extraction from a wide range of CDs, event capable of reading scratched and damaged CDs that are unredable by conventional mechanisms. The onboard digital decoder utilises digital coax and optical outputs to deliver the maxximum versatility.
	The master clock is controlled by a temperature-compensated crystal oscillatorm enabling the digital output from both coaxxial and optical sockets to exhibit vanishingly low levels of jitter (digital distortion)
	
	

	
	In addition, the coaxial output is fed from a differential line driver to ensure a flawless digital signal reaches the accompanying DAC-naturally, the 32-bit DAC section in the 6000A integrated amplifier is a superb sonic match.
	By mounting the transport in its own. electromagnetically shielded enclosure, and including a dedicated powwer supply, the digital signal extraction from any CD as accurate and precise as it is posibble to achive.

		Amplification Redefined
	
		While striving to achieve the most supreme sound quality, each stage of Audiolab product development is focused on usability. In particular with the 8300A, ensuring simple yet in-depth control, veteran amp designer, Jan Ertner build the amplifier functionality around the new display. This means users can easily find their way around the versatile configurations the amplifier offers, even while being much more advanced than its predecessors. The amplifier can behave as an integrated amplifier, power amplifier, pre-amplifier and a split pre-amplifier - easily paired with a multitude of hi-fi systems.
		
		The 8300A works as coherently inside as it does on the outside - By taking a completely new approach to the layout, a dual mono structure means inter-channel interference is minimised. Crucial components processing audio and the power supply are completely separated as far as possible.
		
		Our new technology - Active Current Delivery also ensures a completely clean sound up to the point of clipping, then its advanced microprocessor limits the output, which guarantees no audible distortion, even at its louder output of 75W RMS.

	Design

	Control Where You Need It

	The 8300CD adds full digital preamp functionality, with volume and source selection accessible via the player’s front panel and remote handset. This means the 8300CD can be connected directly to a stereo power amp, or a pair of monoblocks like the new Audiolab 8300MB, as well as to a traditional integrated amp like the equally new Audiolab 8300A.
	
	8300 Series also allows control of music playing from a PC/Mac/media device via USB. When connected to a computer, the 8300CD not only identifies itself as an asynchronous DAC, but also as a HID-compatible device (Human Interface Device). This allows driverless control of the PC/Mac/media player (Play, Pause, Stop, Track Select etc).

	 

	 

	 

	
		Design
	
		New Updated Aesthetic
	
		The newly updated external structure of the 8300 series follows the new design aesthetic of Audiolab products going forward, incorporating softened lines and textures yet still maintaining Audiolab’s instantly recognisable and contemporary style.
		
		The 8300 series’ blasted aluminium finish, CNC routed aluminium dials and display certainly look cutting-edge, yet with every Audiolab product, form follows function. The new display and controls enable a fast and intuitive access through the vast routing options and filter settings in both the A and CD.
	
		 
	
		 
	
		
			Design
		
			Slot-Loading CD Mechanism
		
			Our extensive research and development found that previous tray-style mechanisms sometimes produced a rare weak spot. The 8300CD sports a new mechanism that includes slot loading – much quicker and neater than the old tray.
			
			The new mechanism also reduces the occurrence of disc rejection, able to play CDs that other CD players may reject for being imperfect from dirt or damage. Its digital buffer circuit is a perfect mate to the asynchronous input of the DAC, improving even this area of performance. A final benefit is increased disc stability and reduced susceptibility to resonance, which additionally contributes to the overall improved sound quality.
		
			 
		
			 
		
			
				Design
			
				Connections
			
				Connectivity options have been further expanded on the 8300CD with the addition of an AES/EBU digital input and XLR digital output. These join a full complement of inputs/outputs retained from the 8200CD: 2x coaxial digital inputs; 2x optical digital inputs; 1x asynchronous USB input; 1x coaxial digital output; 1x optical digital output; single-ended RCA and balanced XLR analogue outputs.
				
				On the 8300A Engineers have developed a new phono stage catering for the resurgence in vinyl records with MM and MC configurations accessible via the front panel controls.
				
				12V remote trigger loop feature on all units so as one device is switched on, paired units are switched into or out of standby mode - working as one system for quick operation.
			
				 
			
				 
			
				 
			
				
					Technology
				
					Higher Resolution
				
					The new 8300CD can accept and process data up to 32-bit/384kHz; this is a far higher specification than that required even by current hi-res music formats, ensuring the 8300CD is fully equipped for future advances in ultra-high-definition digital sound.
					
					The USB input now also accepts DSD data, as well as PCM. This is a significant addition, as DSD has an important role to play in the developing high-res digital download scene. Accordingly, the filter section now includes four extra filters for DSD playback, allowing the user to optimise the noise floor to suit the performance of the source file and the bandwidth of associated equipment such as amplifiers and loudspeakers.
					
					The uprated digital processing associated with the increased resolution at the USB input delivers additional sonic benefits, for both CD replay and other connected digital sources, whatever the resolution of the file. In advancing the capability of the USB input to include files of up to 32-bit/384kHz, the processing of data preceding and within the Sabre DAC has increased the subjective resolution of musical detail and dynamics, resulting in a more energetic and transparent performance that sets a new standard for CD players at this price level.
				
					 
				
					 
				
					 
				
					
						Technology
					
						Digital Filter Optimisation
					
						As digital audio reproduction technology has progressed, the importance of the characteristics of reconstruction digital filters has become more appreciated. The Audiolab 8300CD features user-selectable digital filters for optimal listening. These filter settings allow the user to tune the 8300CD’s performance to suit his or her preference, depending on system configuration and musical taste. These filters are available for CD and PCM audio via digital inputs.
						
						• Optimal Spectrum
						• Optimal Transient
						• Optimal Transient XD
						• Optimal Transient DD
						• Sharp Roll Off
						• Slow Roll Off
						• Minimum Phase
						
						the 8300CD also adds four DSD filters that progressively attenuate the out of audio bandwidth noise floor. Given stable, wide-bandwidth amplification and loudspeakers that can handle high power ultrasonic output, the user can choose the widest bandwidth setting of 70K. More modest equipment will benefit from the lower bandwidth settings, as may files that contain little or no recorded ultrasonic musical detail.
						
						The four DSD settings are:
						
						• 70K
						• 60K
						• 50K
						• Normal (47K)";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1184/1/Audiolab8300CD.2copy.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1184/2/Audiolab8300CD.3.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1184/3/Audiolab8300CD.4.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1184/4/Audiolab8300CD.5.jpg

	Technology

	Pure Power

	The 8300MB is quite possibly the perfect example of Audiolab's goal to effortlessly reproduce music with exquisite detail. Not only is 8300MB an extremely powerful amplifier, offering 250W of pure power with high current drive capability, but it also features a fully balanced power stage.
	
	Internally the 8300MB is arranged as two complete power amplifiers which are bridge coupled to the loudspeaker terminals. Each power amplification stage is fed from one of the terminals of the balanced input, therefore the 8300MB operates as a fully balanced amplifier right through to the speaker output.
	
	The benefits are a high level of noise rejection and lower transient distortion plus the ability of the amplifier to draw maximum current from the power supply as required to follow the musical waveform accurately.
	
	It all adds up to a startlingly vivid and highly impactful musical performance that will put more energy into your loudspeakers as well as control them like never before.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1182/1/Audiolab8300MB.2copy.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1182/2/Audiolab8300MB.1.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1182/3/Audiolab8300MB.3.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1182/4/Audiolab8300MB.4.jpg

	Audiolab M-PWR power amplifier matches the Audiolab Q-DAC or M-DAC both sonically and aesthetically, giving you a complete DAC/pre/power solution for your desktop of main system. The M-PWR simply connects to the pre-amp RCA outputs on the Q-DAC (and has provision to connect via balanced XLR outputs for the M-DAC).
	
	The M-PWR is a hotly anticipated product. Following on from the huge success of the Audiolab M-DAC, there is finally a matching component for all Audiolab M-DAC customers who want to add speakers to their system and may have only previously used the M-DAC for headphones listening. M-PWR gives you the option of both and we're on hand to make matching speakers recommendations! M-PWR is rated at 40W making it more than powerful enough for most bookshelf speakers. Equally, for those of you who prefer the features of the stripped down Q-DAC, the M-PWR is an equally impressive match.
	
	For those of you that use your M-DAC or Q-DAC as part of a computer set-up, the M-PWR is attractive thanks to the fact it takes up the same small amount of space as the DAC and is conveniently matched without needing a full hi-fi cabinet to accommodate it. Similarly though, for those of you using the M-DAC within a hi-fi system, the M-DAC and M-PWR should fit on a single shelf of many hi-fi racks, thus offering a complete DAC/pre/power solution from conveniently small cases.

	SOLID 1.25% SILVER CONDUCTORS: Solid conductors eliminate strand-interaction distortion and reduce jitter. Solid silver-plated conductors are excellent for very high-frequency applications, like HDMI audio and video. These signals, being such a high frequency, travel almost exclusively on the surface of the conductor. As the surface is made of high-purity silver, the performance is very close to that of a solid silver cable, but priced much closer to solid copper cable. This is an incredibly cost effective way of manufacturing very high-quality HDMI cables.

	FOAMED-POLYETHYLENE INSULATION: Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy (loss). Some of this energy is stored and then released as distortion. Cinnamon HDMI uses air-filled Foamed-Polyethylene Insulation because air absorbs next to no energy and Polyethylene is low-loss and has a benign distortion profile. Thanks to all the air in Foamed-PE, it causes much less of the out-of-focus effect common to other materials.

	HIGH SPEED DATA CAPACITY: HDMI standards and capabilities have improved significantly since DVI first evolved into HDMI. All generations are backward compatible. However, not all previous HDMI cables can transmit the full 18Gbps of data required to optimize today’s HDMI 2.0 equipment. While there is currently no 4K/60 4:4:4 software requiring the full 18Gbps capability of HDMI 2.0, some sources (UHD Blu-ray players) can be set to upsample, requiring 18Gbps capability. (Upsampling often should be done in the TV rather than in a previous component — but that’s your decision.) It is important to understand that all AudioQuest HDMI cables up to 8 meters are guaranteed to exceed the requirements for all possible HDMI 2.0/HDCP 2.2 data streams, including 4K UltraHD, HDR, and Blu-ray Ultra HD. In addition, AudioQuest Cinnamon makes use of Active Frequency-Equilization to enable full 18Gbps/4K UltraHD performance from 10 to 15 meters.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1443/1/2521077_8d1b59a4-0531-4b22-a707-0b47d58f5eb5_350_350.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1443/2/2521077_8ab7a034-7773-4960-9a18-14dc6fbd0eba_350_350.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1443/3/2521077_66bb3437-c9ea-45e7-904b-a78dc16f5e6f_300_300.jpg;

AC power technology is well over a century old and was never designed to meet the exacting standards of today’s high resolution audio-video components.

Most AC power cords and power conditioner-regenerators, though helpful to a point, are simply not up to the task.

	 

	Power amplifiers present a real challenge for any AC power source, as the transient current requirements (though short in duration) can be many times that of the average (RMS) current consumption. Power amplifiers are also unique from all other components in that the current draw is dynamic, not constant, and it changes with volume and audio signal content. Though many AC power cords may feature low DC resistance to allow for some of this requirement, the characteristic impedance of the AC cable is equally responsible for assuring uncompromised performance. Many premium AC cords constrict or compress the audio transient as their characteristic impedance restricts the transient current.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2289/1/ThunderRevisi.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2289/2/52d89b5b-9571-4ee9-ae9e-8030bf1a9171.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2289/3/947be184-04a3-4858-90b4-34db0e6d8ead.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2289/4/Thunder.jpg

	This two-way centre channel speaker is equippe with a 21/2-inch Balance Mode Radiator (BMR) driver and two 41/2-inch bass drivers. This combination creates a hightended, 3D-audio cinematic exxperience because the BMR radiates not hyst in a narrow cone-shaped format, but across the full 180 degress. This creates a very open sound stage where each soundd effects is perceived to have its own position - wherever you sit. In addtion, because the BMR tweeter responds to frequencies as low as 300Hz (rather than 3000 Hz for traditional tweeters) movie dialogue is delivered from a single source, so there is no single sweet spot for the audience Conventional high0end centre speakers usually deliver dialogue from two midrange speakers either side of a tweeter, but as the listener moves either left or right, one speaker will consequently be close to him and the other will by further away. This differential causes wherever you sit, with intimate, delicate details placed exactly where they were intende just in front of you, far away, or right beside you..whispering into you ear.
	
	
	Main Features
	- BMR
	  Balanced Mode Radiators combine the latest flat panel loudspeaker technology with traditional pistonic-action techniques, The result is 180-degree sound dispersion and a soundstage that places each and every instrumen and vocalist in their own fixed position. Typical high frequency drivers tend to have significanly reduced output level at the top of their range as you ears move off axis from the driver. In other words, if the center of the driver is pointed directly at you ear, it will sound correct but as you move to the side so that you ear is at an Increasing angel to the driver, the high frequencies will ddiminish more quickly compared to the lower frequencies, The wide high-frequency dispersion characteritic of the BMT provides a more consistent sound experience for all of the listeners in the room.
	- Lo-Q cabinet
	  All m-series models are framed by a doublelayer side panel. Each of the two layers is 10 mm thick, an sandwiched between them is the Boston Acoustics specially-developed SDF damping elastomer. This absorbs the internally generated cibration and ensures that the speaker cones remain autonomous. So absolutely nothing is added to the music, and absolutely nothing is taken away
	- Crossover
	  If the drivers are the heart, and the cabinet the body, the crossover is the soul of the speaker. The crossover is an electronic circuit that directs the appropriate sound range to each transducer and maintains the phase/timing accuracy between all of the transducers. All the parts in the crossover - resistors, capacitors, inductors – have an effect on the sound, and choosing the right parts will deliver the sound that the system is truly capable of. Special elements such as low loss film capacitors and low distortion laminated silicon steel core inductors have been used at all critical areas. 
	- Laser-Based vibration management 
	 Laser-based vibration measuring has helped degine the exact, optimised position for each cabinet's internal bracing and mounting locks. This ensures that negative resonance are not just shifted to other frequencies but are totally minimised.

	- Separate Chamber
	  In addition to utilizing Lo-Q contrcution the M350 and M340 also utilize a separate Internal chamber for the Mass-Loadded midrange. This acoustically isolates the midrange from the woofers inside the cabinet so they do not interfere with each other. Another benefit of the separate midrange chamber is that it doubles as a reinforcing brace near the top of the cabinet to add rigidity and reduce cabinet vibrations even further.
	- Standing wave prevention
	  A common problem with conventional floorstanding speakers is the build-up of standing waves and their consequent inteference. No such risk with the M-Series. By using four smaller bass drivers in the M350 and M340 (rather than two larger ones dual oscillation and standing wave creation is simply not possible)
	- Laser-Based vibration management 
	  Laser-based vibration measuring has helped degine the exact, optimised position for each cabinet's internal bracing and mounting locks. This ensures that negative resonance are not just shifted to other frequencies but are totally minimised.

	VINYL AS ITS SUPPOSED TO SOUND
	Whether you're dusting off your recaord collection or embracing analogue thourgh the vinyl revival, there's a unique experience to be had from the moment you drop the needle on your favourite album. to preserve the ynique warmth of the vinyl sound, the Solo phono preamplifier has been carefully designed with a state of the art switch mode power suppyl and anew surface mounted circuit board layboard to reduce unwanted noise.

	WHY CHOOSE A DEDICATED PHONO STAGE?
	Due to the low-level signals created by a turnable, not all hi-fo amplifier will let you connect directly to a record player/ the phono preamplifier boosts this signal to somehing a power amplifier can work with. the challenge at this stateh thpugh is that noise can easily be added. this is why we've designed the Solo araound exceptional components that deliver the warm and detailed sound that's synonymous with vinyl, all without distoring the signal from your moving magnet cartridge. the switch mode power supply improves performance by swiitching outside of audible frequency to drastically reduce hum and new circuit board layout uses surface-mount components to reduce noise.

	ATTENTION TO DETAIL
	If some recaord in your collection are a little worse for wear, the subsonic filter will help to eliminate low frequency rumbles that can be caused by imperfections within your vinyl. Combine this with the balance control for handling potential cartridge imbalacen in your recaord player (that can cause a defference between the left and right channles) and the result is a detailed experience with accurate soundstage

	Our flagship integrated amplifier delivers power, finesse and astonishingly low distortion!

	 

	

	 

	

	Quite literally in a class of its own, the new 851A Class XD integrated amplifier is designed to offer power, finesse and astonishingly low distortion. At its heart lies our own proprietary Class XD technology, which has been refined and enhanced since its inception in the 840 series, allowing even greater musical detail to be delivered to your speakers.

	Like all Cambridge Audio products, the 851A adheres to our three core values: stunning performance, ease of use and incredible value.

	Capable of delivering an enormous 120 watts of high-quality power, it benefits from two audiophile-grade toroidal transformers: one for the sensitive preamp section and one for the power stages allowing the 851A to deliver its immense output without stress. This incredible speaker-taming amount of power can be precision-controlled with another innovation found in the 851A - the new fully balanced silicon gate volume control, which gives very fine adjustment across the volume range and highly accurate channel-balancing.

	Because everyone's needs are different, the 851A offers two main types of connectivity: the more commonly found RCA/Phono inputs, plus two pairs of fully balanced XLR connections. Our matching 851C upsampling CD player also features both types of connection, allowing you to connect your system in the very highest quality possible.

	Speaking of flexibility, you can even control your iPhone, iPad or iPod using the 851 Series remote control when they're docked in our matching iD100 digital dock.

	Unlike many high end amplifiers which excel in one area over another, we believe the 851A offers the perfect combination of high performance, flexibility and ease of use. It's designed to take your listening experience to an entirely different level and we invite you to audition our best amplifier to date at your nearest Cambridge Audio specialist.

		Class XD
	
		Class XD, a proprietary Cambridge Audio technology, is a unique amplifier circuit design created to offer the optimum sound quality currently available from existing amplifier configurations, whilst retaining the high power levels required for truly dynamic performance. It was conceived by our London-based engineering team to combine the best of both worlds from Class A and Class A/B amplifier operation.
		
		Class XD (crossover displacement), gives the benefits of pure Class A operation at low levels and eliminates the distortion associated with conventional Class B operation as the fragile audio signal passes though the zero crossing point from transistor to transistor. Distinct from Class AB, XD technology feeds a controlled current into the output stage in such a way that the usual Class B crossover points no longer occur either side of zero volume - the worst possible position in terms of distortion – but displaced to a point where the transfer functions of the transistors are better matched, at a significant output level where it is less audible. The system operates outside of the feedback loop so is not directly involved in the signal amplification itself.
		 The result is a smooth and linear transition between the two key operating modes, Class A and B.
		
		The benefits of this approach give the sonic refinements of Class A operation and the uncompromising efficiency and power of Class B operation. In fact, the new 851A delivers a gigantic 120 watts per channel - enough for the most demanding speaker set-up.

	ATF2 Upsampling in more detail…

	The 851C makes all your digital audio sound amazing – drawing detail seemingly out of thin air. How?

	 

	
		Our unique ATF2 (Adaptive Time Filtering) upsampling technology, developed in conjunction with Anagram Technologies, Switzerland.
	
		All incoming audio data, such as CD at 16-bit 44.1kHz CD, is upsampled to 24-bit 192kHz using a high-end 32-bit Analog Devices DSP (Digital Signal Processor). ""Polymomial Curve Fitting Interpolation"" provides a much more accurate upsampled audio soundwave than traditional upsampling processes. And a unique timing system buffers audio data to almost eradicate digital jitter. Vital – as jitter, common in digital audio devices, loses vital detail, often leaving digital audio sounding flat and lifeless.
	
		 
	
		
			 
	
	
		 
	
		
	
		 
	
		Our latest ATF2 DSP also features a selectable digital filter with three settings to suit listener preferences and their particular system set-up: 
		
		• The Steep roll-off filter exhibits strong attenuation of aliasing images outside the pass band (i.e. above 22.05kHz) at the expense of a little pre and post-ringing in the time domain. 
		
		• The Linear phase filter uniquely features ‘constant group delay’ which delays all audio signals at all frequencies by the same amount meaning all audio is fully time-coherent at the output.
		
		• Minimum phase meanwhile does not feature constant group delay but rather the co-efficients have been optimised without feed-forward so that the impulse response exhibits no pre-ringing in the time domain.

			COMPLETE DIGITAL PRE-AMPLIFIER
			
			Marking the Cambridge Audio 851D out from its DAC rivals is the unmatched flexibility. Take a deep breath and take in the following. There are a total of six digital inputs including a professional standard AES/EBU, rare BNC, twin dedicated opticals plus two more inputs offering the option of coaxial or optical. There is also an asynchronous USB link that supports high resolution audio files up to 192kHz, making the 851D ideal for high resolution music playback from your computer. In terms of connecting the DAC to your amp, take your pick from optical or coaxial digital and RCA or XLR analogue. Throw in a control bus link, RS232 socket and trigger out for multi-room system control and it's hard to see how the 851D could be any better equipped. With the supplied remote control offering a switchable volume control there may be no need to add a pre-amp at all*. Just add a power amp or active speakers and you're all set to go.
		
			BLUETOOTH CONNECTED
			
			Supplied with the Cambridge Audio BT100 Bluetooth dongle, the 851D even accommodates Bluetooth music transfers from your smartphone, tablet, laptop or other compatible devices. Whilst this may not offer quite the quality of other streaming sources, it's enormously handy to have when playing background music. Thanks to A2DP plus aptX support the quality is also extremely high by Bluetooth standards.
			
			SUPERIOR COMPONENTS FOR SUPERB SOUND
			
			At the heart of the 851D are two Analogue Devices AD1955 24-bit DACs in dual differential formation. Each DAC handles just one channel for excellent stereo imaging, operating fully in differential mode for exceptionally low distortion and noise. What this equates to for the listener is an exceptionally unforced, natural sound quality. Instruments and vocals ""breath"" with emotion and depth. Rather than sounding grey and mechanical, the Azur 851D uses colour, texture and fluidity of sound to create a sense of realism often lost on DACs of this price.
		
			ATF2 AUDIO UPSAMPLING FOR A SMOOTHER SOUND
			
			The high quality DACs are complemented by a new Anagram Technologies ATF2 24 bit/384 kHz up-sampling circuit. Up-sampling lower resolution sources ""stretches"" them to give the highest resolution possible. It also aids standard 24-bit/192kHz recordings with a faster sampling rate for less jitter. Up-sampling sound gives a smoother, more relaxed sound quality with added detail. You'll also notice enhanced depth of sound and a more natural quality without the ""edge"" that can afflict digital music. You'll hear every detail, including the odd cough, squeaky chair and flutter of sheet music; in short, it's like being there for real!
		
			TAILORED SOUND
			
			As we all prefer slightly different nuances of sound quality, the 851D comes with Cambridge Audio's triple filter system. Select from Linear Phase, Minimal Phase or Steep modes and you can subtly alter the sound quality. You might even find certain types of music sound better with a particular filter engaged.
			
			FULL METAL CASING WITH EXTENSIVE DAMPING
			
			Using a full metal casing, with rounded edges, doesn't just look and feel good, it helps the sound, too. The case is rigid and well-damped, meaning that it won't resonate unhelpfully. The thick aluminium front panel looks the part and also acts as a shield against electrical interference from sources such as dimmers and RF devices. All these details combine to create a DAC that not only looks stylish but also offers exceptional resistance to both mechanical and electrical interference.
			
			Unequivocally the best DAC we've ever sold, with a level of connectivity that also puts it in a class of its own, the Cambridge Audio 851D is the ultimate heart of your digital system.
			
			*Conventional pre-amplifier required if connecting analogue sources to your system; such as turntable, tuner or cassette deck plus CD players without digital output.

	The pinnacle of digital and streaming performance – the 851N is the ultimate network player. It’s features include; 24-bit/384kHz upsampling from all sources, native 24-bit/192kHz playback, USB, digital audio inputs and streaming over wi-fi including UPnP and NAS drives, Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay, and DSD.

	The 851N takes almost any digital file from virtually any source and renders it to the highest possible standard. Every digital source becomes a hi-fi option; its wireless options include Wi-Fi, internet radio, Spotify, Airplay. Add an optional BT100 Bluetooth dongle, and any paired Bluetooth device is connected.
	Digital source components, such as a smartphone, set-top box or PC can connect via optical, co-axial or AES/EBU inputs, while other media are supported with Ethernet, USB and Audio USB.

	Music files in all the popular formats are supported, from MP3, through to FLAC/Apple Lossless and WAV 16-24 bit master files.
	Thanks to our proprietary ATF2 audio upsampling, the 851N upsamples everything to 24-bit / 384kHz. The audio signal then passes through two Analog Devices DACs in dual differential mode for the very finest digital to analogue conversion. As well as connecting the 851N to a traditional integrated amplifier, it can also be configured as a digital pre-amp allowing it to be connected directly to a power amp such as the 851W for further sonic purity.

	
		
			
				Beautiful sound
			
				The 851N uses twin premium Analog Devices DACs in ‘dual differential’ mode. Each stereo channel processes information separately for greater accuracy, while 2nd generation AFT upsamples everything to 24-bit/384kHz, dramatically reducing jitter. A toroidal transformer and rigid metal case further contribute to the 851N’s beautiful sound.
			
				
					
						Digital pre-amp
					
						With the option of being configured in digital pre-amp mode, the 851N can be connected directly to dedicated power amplifiers as well traditional integrated amps. Keeping the signal digital to the last moment makes it less susceptible to analogue deterioration, while a 32-bit SHARC DSP controls the volume output; by keeping the entire signal digital the best possible sound is achieved, even at very low volume levels.
					
						
							
								
									Ultra connectivity
								
									The 851N connects with as many digital sources as possible. So whether the music is on an MP3 player, a hard drive, NAS drive, your PC or the web, there’s a suitable input. Spotify and Airplay compatibility are built in, add a BT100 Bluetooth dongle to pair a device and let your tablet or iPhone become bona fide hi-fi devices.

	Class XD amplification – Cambridge Audio's proprietary amplification system switches dynamically between Class A and AB systems. Class A amplification delivers the purest possible sound, using only one transistor to conduct, but can be energy inefficient. Class AB involves both transistors conducting simultaneously, but makes it impossible to maintain a balance of low crossover distortion and power efficiency. Our Class XD system operates in both Class A and Class AB mode, dynamically moving the crossover point depending on the audio output volume. This combines the near zero crossover distortion of pure Class A with improved efficiency of Class AB at higher volumes, without any compromises in performance for the best of both world.

	Serious power – 200W into 8 Ohms stereo mode is serious power. But for those with bigger plans, the 851W is usable in a mono bridged configuration with each amplifier delivering 500W RMS.

	Two toroidal transformers – Separate, high-end transformers for the power amplifier and input and other circuitry ensure audio performance is unaffected by the dramatic current output swings required to drive demanding speakers, by keeping power supplies entirely separate.

	Terrapin impedance buffering modules – Cambridge Audio's proprietary modules replace the op-amps commonly found in similar amplifiers. At the critical low level gain stages, these offer far improved stereo separation and imaging – unheard of at this price point.

	CAP5 proprietary protection – Protects the integrity of your system by avoiding DC spikes, overheating, short circuits or clipping.

					THE HEART OF YOUR DIGITAL MUSIC SYSTEM
			
			
				
					POWER PRECISION AND DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY
			
			
				
					Designing the CX Series amplifiers was a labour of love; the product of a team dedicated to extracting every drop of pleasure and detail from all genres of music. These amplifiers will help you discover a new dimension of sound. The CXA80 must be heard to be believed. Rated at 80 Watts per channel, its class AB amplifier design will reveal spectacular detail in your music. Separate dual mono windings on a low-flux toroidal transformer further enhance performance and together these design details deliver incredible control over your speakers on a wide, enveloping, captivating sound stage.
			
			
				
					To journey deeper into the music you love, the CXA80 has been designed from the ground up with built-in digital to analogue conversion capabilities. Using a high-specification 24-bit/192kHz WM8740 DAC chip from Wolfson, the CXA80 offers a powerful upgrade for all your digital sources. And because we’ve designed it with digital in mind, it features two optical inputs, a co-axial digital input and an asynchronous USB Audio socket, so you can play your music directly from your PC or Mac. Add an optional BT100 Bluetooth dongle and you’ve got aptX streaming direct from your smartphone or tablet, allowing access to music from Spotify, Youtube, and a host of others.
			
			
				
					Analogue sources are equally well catered for with balanced XLR inputs, RCA inputs and a front 3.5mm aux jack. In use, the CXA80 is a delight. The floating effect of the chassis, the brushed finish, and the easy-to-read front panel, all create an amplifier that’s as beautiful on the outside as it’s well engineered on the inside.
				
					Whatever your source, the CXA80 will reveal new depths and layers of sound, letting you re-discover your favourite music.
				
					 
				
					
						Choosing the DAC
					
						Both our CXA60 and CXA80 amplifiers employ the same Wolfson WM8740 DAC, and there’s a very good reason for that: it sounds superb! There are more recent Wolfson DACs in circulation, however none sound quite as great as the WM8740 in our view. Which is why, time and again, we choose them.
				
				
					
						 
					
						
							Two-into-one transformer
						
							The CXA80 utilises two separate windings on the oversize toroidal transformer. In effect, this is like having two toroidal transformers wound onto one chassis, providing separate windings for each amplification module. If you get a huge transient in the right channel, it won’t unsettle what’s going on in the left. The current is being drawn from a different path, rather than a common path, so the output is stable and remains unflustered, whether your liking is for Little Richard or Lamb of God.
						
							Dynamic Thermal Tracking transistors
						
							The transistors used by the CXA80 are not your usual common or garden offerings. They come with an integrated Dynamic Thermal Tracking System. So what does this mean? Normally a Power Output transistor utilises a thermo-coupler attached directly to the heat sink of the amp; this informs the system so that it can rebias when key temperatures are reached. However, using Integrated Dynamic Thermal tracking provides a far more accurate reading of the real temperature of a transistor, and relays it faster too because it’s not a delayed heating effect. This enables us to bias the amplifier more accurately and in almost real time. Which means your CXA80 is always running at optimum performance.
						
							Musical Subwoofer output
						
							If you want to use a subwoofer as part of your speaker complement, the CXA80 doesn’t penalise you for it. Because we want to ensure there’s no unnecessary high frequency noise affecting the subwoofer, we’ve put the output filter at 3KHz. This is high enough to prevent any phase shift associated with the low pass filter affecting what happens below 200Hz. The result is a phase linear subwoofer output signal which is clean and musical.
						
							Reinventing the signal path
						
							The CX range represents a step change in the way our engineers have approached signal path design, and the result is one of our most musical and entertaining amplifiers yet.
						
							 
						
							Previously, we went to almost surgical lengths to minimise distortion in order to get the best results. This invariably meant 46 components sat in the signal path. For the CX Series, we wanted to dramatically reduce that component count. The CXA80 now has only 24 components in the signal path. The big difference is that there are now 500 support components as well. Their job is to guarantee those 24 key components are absolutely optimal all the time, regardless of mains fluctuations and other influences.
						
							This has made a big difference when it comes to tuning. Previously, tweaking one of the 46 components only made a small difference and it was sometimes difficult to quantify exactly what difference any change made. With the CX series, those 24 components have now actually become quite critical. Changing just one affects the character of the amplifier.We can hear very clearly what each of those components is doing.
						
							 
						
							This revision has fundamentally changed the character of the amplifier. Listening to a CX series amplifier is fun, engaging and exciting.
						
							High resolution asynchronous USB
						
							In order to offer 24-bit 192kHz resolution via asynchronous USB we use a specialist XMOS device dedicated to the USB input. We’ve also written a custom driver to allow PC users to access the higher sample rates available in USB Audio 2 mode. This bespoke code allows us to stream audio files at the highest possible resolution.
						
							Bespoke Bluetooth
						
							If you want to use your CXA80 with a Bluetooth source, we offer an optional BT100 audio receiver. To ensure that this does not interfere with other components in the amplifier, it’s isolated internally on the digital input board. From the ground up, this is an audiophile Bluetooth device. All the coding for the BT100, including the aptX implementation, is done in-house. We even include an extension cable which enables you get the best Bluetooth range.
						
							Embracing classic design
						
							Sometimes there’s a good reason to keep things uncomplicated. The CXA80 features a high-quality damped metal chassis, designed to ensure that nothing rattles or interferes with the electronics. We’ve also kept volume control simple. The CXA80 uses a logarithmic ALPS pot. And when it comes to switching inputs, the CXA80 uses relay switching with silver plated contacts. This classic approach is still the best way to move signals around, rather than with transistors or electronic switches.

	Cambridge Audio 851W

	 

	Class XD amplification – Cambridge Audio's proprietary amplification system switches dynamically between Class A and AB systems. Class A amplification delivers the purest possible sound, using only one transistor to conduct, but can be energy inefficient. Class AB involves both transistors conducting simultaneously, but makes it impossible to maintain a balance of low crossover distortion and power efficiency. Our Class XD system operates in both Class A and Class AB mode, dynamically moving the crossover point depending on the audio output volume. This combines the near zero crossover distortion of pure Class A with improved efficiency of Class AB at higher volumes, without any compromises in performance for the best of both world.

	Serious power – 200W into 8 Ohms stereo mode is serious power. But for those with bigger plans, the 851W is usable in a mono bridged configuration with each amplifier delivering 500W RMS.

	Two toroidal transformers – Separate, high-end transformers for the power amplifier and input and other circuitry ensure audio performance is unaffected by the dramatic current output swings required to drive demanding speakers, by keeping power supplies entirely separate.

	Terrapin impedance buffering modules – Cambridge Audio's proprietary modules replace the op-amps commonly found in similar amplifiers. At the critical low level gain stages, these offer far improved stereo separation and imaging – unheard of at this price point.

	CAP5 proprietary protection – Protects the integrity of your system by avoiding DC spikes, overheating, short circuits or clipping.

	Integration – Smart auto-standby mode detects incoming audio signals to simplify integration with Cambridge Audio preamplifiers.

	All-metal chassis – Including extensive use of aluminium to create massive structural rigidity, careful damping and control of acoustic resonance.

	Revel Concerta 2 F36

	 

	The Concerta2 F36 floorstanding loudspeaker was designed to deliver outstanding accuracy over a remarkably wide frequency range. The 2 1/2-way triple 6.5” floorstanding loudspeaker has the ability to provide performance worthy of the most demanding entertainment systems.
	High frequency response is supported by 1 inch aluminum dome tweeters that were derived from Revel’s Performa3 series. Low/Mid range frequency response is supported by 6.5” Aluminum cone woofers featuring low-distortion motor-structures for greater clarity and accuracy with improved sensitivity and output capability. 
	
	The patented wave guide design improves tweeter to woofer blend and significantly improves off-axis response for consistent performance over a wide listening area. In doing this we sacrificed no details by making sure no fasteners were visible allowing the speaker to show enhancing smooth lines of the cabinet and magnetically attached grilles. To finish the enclosure we selected high gloss black and white finishes to highlight the features of this beautiful speaker.

	Before installation

	
	Switch off all equipment before fitting or removing cables.
	Connect cable so the print on the cable reads away from the source component. The “C” of “Chord” should be nearest the source component.
	Route the cable away from speaker cables and power cables.

	 

	Strike A Chord

	 

	It may be a budget cable but Chord's C-line uses the company’s own Tuned ARAY cable creation technique (Tuned Aray was initially designed for digital cables and was a way of reducing reflections back up the cable) and was originally used on the top-of-the-line Sarum cable. 

	The C-Line is the first cable in the Chord range to be built be a third party partner. It includes oxygen-free copper conductors and is optimally used with front-end components such as CD players, streamers and the like. Plugs are gold-plated while strain relief has been applied to the plug’s terminations. You can buy the cable in either 1m or half metre lengths. 

	 

	Sound Quality

	 

	Diving straight into sound testing for the 1m interconnect cable, I also pulled out my first budget cable reference, the Epiphany Atratus II priced at £65/m. I turned to Venice Blue from Bobby Darin on vinyl. 

	The Chords had an immediate impact on the dynamic range, stretching it to new extremes as the upper mids were extended, allowing the Darin vocal delivery to become expansive and to reach further. Similarly, the bass was now more recognisable with the bass guitar offering a richer ‘twang’ with greater power and heft to the instrument. 

	The strings which flowed throughout the song sounded particular free and sweeping during the introductory portion of the song, providing more emotion while the secondary percussion was able to provide a secure rhythmic support. 

	In general terms, the song exhibted greater transparency in its presentation, almost as if a curtain had been lifted from the front of the speakers. This gave the soundstage a clearer and more natural effect. Darin now sounded at ease in his performance. 

	Turning to a more dynamic genre of music and The Who song, Baba O’Riley on CD, The Chords were, this time, compared to the rather more expensive Epiphany Atratus III cables (priced at £100/m). Compared to the latter, the Chords were slighter warmer in tone. This could be immediately heard during the complex introductory synth section of the song. 

	Added warmth in budget cables does not detract from synth replay, however, which bodes well if you are fan of this genre. The introductory piano retained the power of the Atratus III but lacked a touch of upper mid extension while the drums retained a heft with a reassuring weighty mass that gave the track a solid foundation. 

	When the song reached the Pete Townshend vocal break, midway through the song, the Atratus III cables were noticeable in adding a slight touch of upper mid bloom during crescendos. The Chords never suffered from this problem. The added warmth and the slightly lower midrange extension just pulled back from the edge meaning that there was no bloom effect. The same could be said for a later sequence during Roger Daltrey’s crescendos.  

	The Chord warmth had pros and cons for jazz. Playing Dexter Gordon's I Was Doing all Right, the tonal direction of the Chords allowed both the sax and trumpet solos to flow with ease, despite a slight restriction in the dynamic range when compared to the Atratus III reference.

	Accompanying percussion confirmed this effect because, while the rim shots remained powerful, they lacked a touch of sharpness while the  cymbals produced more of a warm fuzz than a clear cloud of shimmer. Despite this slight midrange recess of the Chords affecting the treble options of the song, the attractive warmth of the lower mids and upper bass was ideal for harder rocking tracks. High energy music was never grating or bright while guitar solos packed both power and force. 

	 

	Conclusion

	 

	The Chord C-line provides a far superior sonic replay to basic, bundled cables and even trounces more expensive, audiophile designs. It’s only when we get to cables at twice the price that a slight midrange and treble recess appears which may give fans of jazz and singer-songwriters pause for thought. Nevertheless, this cable is highly recommended for budget use. Above that, as shown by the reference Atratus III reference, you will need to seek a careful demonstration.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/924/1/chordc-line.png;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/924/2/1012.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/924/3/th_DSC03244_LR5.jpg;

That foil acts as a shield, which Chord says is particularly effective at blocking harmful high frequency interference. What it’s protecting is a pair of stranded copper wires, twisted together.";"During the development of the Chord Clearway, valuable research was carried out in relation to the behaviour of conductors and different dielectrics (insulation). For a long time, they have understood the importance of the relationship between conductor materials and insulation, and its silver-plated speaker cables make extensive use of PTFE as an insulation material. 
	
	The type of insulation doesn’t just affect a cable’s ability to carry signals accurately, it also has an effect on the tonal characteristics that the cable brings to the system. This often takes the form of an unwanted increase in bass frequencies, which directly limits a system’s ability to produce music with coherence and involvement.
	
	Typically, cables that use oxygen-free copper as a conductor material will use either polyethylene or PVC as an insulating material. What sets The Chord Company’s Clearway speaker cable apart is its use of FEP: a derivative of PTFE with very similar performance characteristics. Compared to polyethylene, the FEP-insulated Clearway carries both detail and dynamic information markedly more accurately. The tonal properties of the cable are also considerably more neutral.
	
	The FEP-insulated conductors are built from multi-strand oxygen-free copper and are arranged in a twisted-pair configuration to reduce interference. The two conductors are then protected with a layer of soft PVC (which was chosen over polyethylene because of its flexibility), in order to correctly space the shielding in relation to the conductors and to minimise any mechanically induced noise. 
	
	HIGH FREQUENCY SHIELDING :
	
	High-performance shielding is specified and just like the award-winning Carnival SilverScreen, Chord Clearway speaker cable features two contra-wound high-density foil shields. Like many Chord speaker cables, the twin foils, combined with the twisted-pair configuration, make for a level of shielding that is effective to high frequencies. Finally, a clear protective PVC jacket is applied, which again serves to further reduce any mechanically induced noise.

	The Cable
	
	Crimson VEE 3 cable is a pseudo-balanced/symmetrical cable design.  There are two sets of multi-strand oxygen free copper conductors, one set used for the signal and the other set for the return.  The conductors are twisted and are insulated with a low density, low loss polyethylene.  Chord use the pseudo-balanced configuration because it carries signals more accurately than a simple coaxial or asymmetrical cable.  The conductors are held in place with two vibration damping cotton spacers.  Reducing vibration both internally and externally is extremely important to signal quality.
	
	The conductors and spacers are wrapped with a natural cotton filler before the critical dual-layer shielding is applied.  The shield comprises of a high-density braid and an overlapped foil.  This combination of shields extends the performance of the shield across a wider bandwidth.  The shield is fully floating.  The shielding is then surrounded with a soft PVC to further improve mechanical damping and this is then protected with a hard PVC outer layer.

	The conductors and spacers are wrapped with a natural cotton filler before the critical dual-layer shielding is applied.  The shield comprises of a high-density braid and an overlapped foil.  This combination of shields extends the performance of the shield across a wider bandwidth.  The shield is fully floating.  The shielding is then surrounded with a soft PVC to further improve mechanical damping and this is then protected with a hard PVC outer layer.  
	
	The Plugs
	
	The Chord Crimson VEE 3 is fitted with Chord’s custom VEE 3 RCA plug.  The new design of the ABS outer shell and the unique gold-plating process applied to the contact areas improves signal transfer across a wider frequency range.  The signal return surround provides a secure high-pressure contact with all types of RCA sockets.  The centre pin is insulated with PTFE and the design of the plug provides good strain relief without compressing the cable and compromising the performance.  
	
	Use it with
	
	The design of the Crimson VEE 3, the gauge of its conductors and its highly effective screening means that the Crimson VEE 3 will perform extremely well over long runs with minimal signal loss and interference. These are all the important areas to think about when it comes to subwoofer cable. The Crimson VEE 3 works really and is a cost effective solution when it comes to considering the long runs of cable often needed for subwoofer connections. - See more at: http://www.chord.co.uk/product/chord-crimson-vee-3-rca-subwoofer-cable/#sthash.gkFkisZz.dpuf

	
		“Great balance between cost and performance, the highly effective shielding means that really long lengths are not a problem.”
	
		Whatever the level of home cinema system you have, the subwoofer plays a crucial role in bringing the proper home cinema experience into your living room.
	
		The high quality shielding and twin conductor configuration of the Crimson VEE 3 cable will help to properly define and articulate the signal fed to your subwoofer. This may seem like something important for music, (it is), but it’s just as important for films as well.
	
		The VEE 3 RCA plug plays a part as well, the direct gold-plated contact helping to ensure the best signal transfer and bring an extra degree of precision to each piece of subwoofer drama.

	Chord Epic Twin speaker cable

	CONDUCTORS: 2 x 12 AWG multi-stranded silver-plated oxygen free copper.

	CONFIGURATION: Twisted pair configuration.

	CONDUCTOR INSULATION: PTFE. We believe that to obtain the most neutral tonal characteristic from silver-plated conductors it is vital to use PTFE insulation. White with red stripe is positive; white with black stripe is negative. Conductors surrounded by silicone to minimise mechanical noise.

	SHIELDING: Dual layer, high density braid and overlapped foil.

	JACKET: PVC. DIAMETER: 11mm. COLOUR: Translucent brown.

	APPLICATIONS: Epic takes its conductors from Odyssey and its shielding from Signature speaker cable. The shielding brings big improvements not just to high frequencies but also the bass frequencies. There is space around individual instruments and the true timbre of instruments is easy to hear. Violins, cellos and violas sound more realistic, likewise pianos.  Epic is very compatible and will work well with almost every system.

	 

	Chord Epic speaker cable is the result of a successful marriage of two of our award winning speaker cables.  The silver-plated oxygen free copper conductors, PTFE insulation and silicone surround are borrowed from Chord Odyssey speaker cable and the shielding system is taken from the Chord Signature speaker cable.  The development and success of Signature speaker cable proved conclusively that shielding speaker cable could bring some serious improvements to sound quality.  The lessons learned during its development means that we can now apply the same principles to other cables within the Chord range.  Chord Epic is a highly effective shielded cable with many of the performance characteristics of the more expensive Chord Signature. 

	Fitting shielding systems to speaker cables can bring the same sort of benefits to the sound
	of a system that improving the shields on interconnects does.  The reduction and the level of perceived noise means that very fine dynamic and tonal information is easily heard and brings improvements not only to the high frequency performance of a system, but also the bass and mid frequencies.  The space around notes and the extra harmonic content that Epic can bring to a system is really surprising.  The complex harmonic information that makes up the timbre of stringed and bowed instruments is carried extremely accurately.

	The lower noise floor also makes micro dynamic information easier to hear and it is simpler to follow, understand and become more involved with, even the most complex pieces of music.

	Use it with:  Chord Cadenza, Chord Chorus 2 , Chord Anthem 2 and Chord Signet

	Chord Leyline speaker cable has been designed to offer good quality signal transmission over extremely long runs.  This makes Leyline ideal for use in multi-room installations and home cinema systems using discreet speakers.  Leyline will carry an audio signal over lengths of 50 plus metres with minimal signal loss.  

	To achieve this performance the oxygen free copper multi-strand conductors have been tin-plated.  This technique was chosen after experimentation showed that tin-plated conductors helped to minimize signal loss.  The conductors are arranged in a twisted pair configuration and insulated with polyethylene.  They are surrounded with a strong, high density PVC jacket that makes the cable easy to install and protects the conductors.  

	Although Leyline is most commonly used to carry signals from a central amplifier in multi-room installations, it is also becoming an increasingly popular choice for use in compact hi-fi and home cinema systems.  Its high performance will help to produce excellent sound quality from even the smallest speakers and its discreet size and colour make it inconspicuous and simple to install

All Tuned ARAY cables have an extraordinary degree of musical transparency and the Shawline Analogue transforms the performance of the new breed of DACs, CD players and Streamers that deliver so much performance at very affordable prices.

	The challenge with producing the Shawline Analogue is that all Tuned ARAY cables require a high degree of precision that can only be achieved with painstaking hand assembly. The Shawline is built from FEP insulated silver-plated conductors and use a composite shielding material that works over a wide bandwidth and also reduces mechanical noise. The cable is assembled within a flexible plastic tube chosen to further reduce mechanical noise and a protective outer braid is fitted.

	Shawline Analogue RCA cables are turntable-ready as standard.

		Chord Signature speaker cable was the first shielded speaker cable that we produced and it’s been part of our range of speaker cables for the past ten years.  The original Signature speaker cable is still as impressive as it ever was, but with the development of our flagship Sarum speaker cable we learnt so much that we’ve been able to completely re-design Signature speaker cable to produce Signature Reference speaker cable.
	
		We’ve improved the shielding, we’ve made changes to the spacing between the conductors and the shield and we’ve changed all the materials.  The new Signature Reference features silver-plated conductors in combination with PTFE insulation and the new shield is of a higher density. 
	
		The changes have brought all the improvements we were hoping for and more.  It isn’t as though the original Signature was exactly lacking when it came to levels of detail with its ability to carry dynamic information and the coherence and involvement it brought to any system it was put into.  The new Signature Reference though takes everything to another level and there’s more than a hint of the outstanding capabilities of Sarum speaker cable.
	
		Extremely neutral, musically transparent and capable of producing profound improvements in all the systems we’ve tried it in.
	
		Signature Reference is built in the same way as the original Signature.  Each set is made to order and the two conductors are held in place with a precision machined aluminium clamp and twisted along their length to improve flexibility (Signature Reference is markedly more flexible than the original Signature).  The aluminium clamp is designed to hold the cable securely but avoid any compression on the cable itself.  Like Signature, Signature Reference is available in red and black and also in all black as well.  We loved the look of the original Signature but we think that Signature Reference looks wonderful in all black.

The OBERON 9 is a true three-way high-end Hi-Fi speaker that combines ultimate refinement and startling detail with effortless power to reproduce music and film at real life volume levels. OBERON 9 can bring genuine concert and cinema experiences right into your home.

	 

	The OBERON 9 features a dedicated 7"" midrange woofer supported by twin 9"" woofers. All woofers are low-loss and optimised with a new wood fibre structured cone which is dedicated to reproduce the delicate midrange and bass frequency area - like every other driver made by DALI. It is constructed from a blend of fine grain paper pulp and reinforced with wood fibres, which creates a stiff, light-weight and well-behaving structure. In combination with a low-loss surround and spider suspension, this cone reproduces the micro details in the signal - unfiltered and with high accuracy.

	Contour 30 steps it up a notch from the 20. Of course, it still treads the same path – one of honesty, transparency and sheer entertainment, but it puts it all in a bigger package.

	Like the rest of the new Contour i family, the 30i has the all-new Esotar 2i tweeter – complete with the Hexis inner dome found throughout our flagship Confidence range and also in the Core series of professional studio reference monitors (trickle-down tech is an amazing thing, isn’t it…). Esotar 2i also gets a new, larger rear chamber. This, together with Hexis, helps to reduce unwanted resonances and smooth out the frequency response for even clearer, sweeter high-frequencies.

	 

	We’ve endowed Contour 30 with two 18cm MSP drivers, as well as doubling up on the rear ports. Behind the scenes we’ve tweaked the spider suspension (the springy ring that keeps the woofer in the right place when it’s at rest, and controls it in the right way when it’s moving). This one is made from aramid fibres, and retains the ingenious structural properties from before (the ribs are of varying width to give even finer control over the cone’s excursion).

We’d put money on your pal asking where’s the rest of the speakers are. That’s when you smile, shrug and invite them to sit down in the sweet-spot on your sofa. And then turn it up a bit more.

We’ve been creating speakers that perform out of all proportion to their physical size for over 40 years, and Evoke 10 is no exception. These are serious hi-fi… built for serious entertainment.";"-Classic Dynaudio heritage… with a twist
	Each speaker’s single 14cm long-throw mid/bass driver is made from MSP just like all Dynaudio speakers have used for decades. They use new surrounds to extend their throw, their frequency response and their low-frequency dynamics – all while maintaining stellar midrange performance.
	-The diaphragm is 0.4mm thin, which provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to ensure optimum performance.
	-The 38mm voice-coil itself is made from aluminium, making it extremely light. That means we can use more windings. More windings gives us more control over the cone’s movement
	-And the whole assembly is driven by one of our new, powerful strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet systems
	-Cerotar: a brand-new tweeter
	Up top is the brand-new 28mm Cerotar soft-dome tweeter. Our engineers looked behind the curtain of the award-winning Special Forty and money-no-object Confidence tweeters and cherry-picked some key technologies to bring to Evoke. The headline-grabbing component is the Hexis

Evoke 20 is a full-size stand-mounted speaker designed for almost any sized space. Its powerful 18cm mid/bass driver ensures it can flex its muscles when there’s heavy lifting to be done, while its 28mm soft-dome tweeter takes care of the fine detail. And, of course, its Danish design looks fantastic wherever you put it. It’s an ideal match.

Evoke 20 has been designed by people who love music. They’ve crafted it from hundreds of hours of intensive measuring and listening – real listening, to real music, in real rooms. So when you play your collection, you know you’re hearing what they heard… something new.";"dvanced driver technology
	The 0.4mm thick, 18cm Esotec+ woofer is made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a proprietary material that we’ve been using in our speaker cones for decades. It provides the perfect balance of lightness, stiffness and damping that, combined with its new strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system, reproduces midrange and bass frequencies in perfect balance.

	The whole diaphragm is made from one piece of MSP. Rather than gluing on a dust cap or just leaving a hole, this construction makes the cone far more rigid – and means far less physical distortion. It gives a much better physical connection to the voice-coil, which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm via the Balance Ribs around the centre.

	Evoke 20’s 52mm voice-coil is made from aluminium. We chose that over copper for this speaker because it gives the correct balance of weight and winding height to give bass frequencies power and enough mechanical and electrical damping, while also letting midrange frequencies (where a vast amount of musical detail lies) sing through clearly.

	A Nomex spider keeps everything centred and moving the way it should, while the new, seamless Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater power and punch.

	The all-new Cerotar tweeter
	The tweeter is brand new. It’s called Cerotar, and is based on key technologies from our award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter and the mighty new Esotar3, which you’ll find in the top-of-the-line Confidence series.

	Like all our other tweeters, it’s a 28mm unit and uses a precision-coated soft dome. This coating is applied in exactly the correct places and thicknesses to optimise high-frequency performance – it’s a process derived from the development of our most exclusive speakers.

	But that’s where the similarity to everything except Confidence ends. Hidden behind the dome is a part called the Hexis: a special inner dome that shapes airflow to smooth-out the frequency response and eliminate unwanted resonances that would affect high-frequency performance.

	As with the Esotec+ woofer, it’s driven by a new strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet for increased sensitivity, improved detail resolution and a natural, dynamic response.

	That’s all a posh way of saying “it sounds really sweet, and you can listen to it for hours without even a hint of fatigue”. Time to get those prog-rock quadruple gatefold albums out of the attic…

	A design for life
	Our design department took field trips to show-homes, home-interiors stores and real-life dwellings in Denmark to hone Evoke 20’s look. It was important for them to be able to imagine the speakers in a variety of living spaces – because, after all, that’s how most people listen. They’re on a couch, with a coffee, and a dog… these speakers had to be hygge.

	That’s why the four finishes are so relatable. You can choose from Black High Gloss and White High Gloss (which both use new lacquering techniques for a stunning glass-like surface), as well as the warm and organic open-veneered Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood styles.

	The cabinets themselves are tapered and rounded in a nod to the Contour and Confidence ranges. The mounting screws are hidden behind stylish one-piece trim rings. And because good design doesn’t age, you know they’ll look every bit as stylish when you’re still listening to them in 30 years.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1976/1/Evoke20RevisiAC.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1976/2/evoke_20_black_front.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1976/3/g345EV20BG-F.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1976/4/g345EV20BG-M.jpg

	Like the rest of the Evoke range, the tweeter is the brand-new Cerotar. It’s based on key technologies from our award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter, and the mighty new Esotar3, which you’ll find in the top-of-the-line Confidence series.

	Like all Dynaudio tweeters, it uses a precision-coated soft dome. This coating is applied in exactly the correct places and thicknesses to optimise high-frequency performance – it’s a process derived from our most exclusive speakers.

	But that’s where the similarity to everything except Confidence ends. Hidden behind the dome is a part called the Hexis: a special inner dome that shapes airflow to smooth-out the frequency response and eliminate unwanted resonances that would affect high-frequency performance.

	The Cerotar tweeter is powered by a new strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet for increased sensitivity, improved detail resolution and a natural, dynamic response.

	That’s all a posh way of saying “even if you’re watching one of those box-sets that lasts for nine hours, your ears won’t get tired”. Which, of course, is exactly as it should be.

	New woofer technology
	Evoke 25C’s twin 14cm Esotec+ mid/bass drivers are made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a material we’ve been using for our woofer diaphragms since the dawn of Dynaudio. It provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to balance the needs of precise bass performance with clear, detailed midrange.

	Each speaker cone is crafted from a single piece of MSP. This makes them exactly the right amount of rigid – and means far less physical distortion when they’re playing. It also gives a super-solid physical connection to the glass-fibre voice-coil former on the back (it’s glued directly under the Balance Ribs you’ll see around the centre), which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm.

	The 38mm voice-coils themselves are made from aluminium, making them extremely light. That means we can use more windings. More windings gives us more control over the cone’s movement, which means more control over the sound – even at high volumes and high frequencies. That’s especially important in a centre speaker, which predominantly deals with speech – its midrange performance has to be absolutely top-notch.

	The woofer motor is kept stable, centred and true by the Nomex spider (the circular spring assembly that stops the cone moving when it shouldn’t, and lets it move when it should), while the new Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater punch. And, like the Cerotar tweeter, the woofers are both driven by ceramic Ferrite+ magnets for greater control, finesse and power.

	In non-speaker-designer language, that means “you’ll hear your movie the way it was meant to be heard”. No rough edges, nothing standing out where it shouldn’t – and nothing relegated to a cameo when it should be the lead.

	Made for (home) movies
	Our design department took drew inspiration from show-homes, home-interiors stores and real-life dwellings in Denmark to hone Evoke 25C’s look. After all, it’s as much a piece of furniture as the couch you sit on to watch your movies.

These two-and-a-half-way speakers strike the balance between compactness and restraint, and unabashed, wide-eyed enthusiasm for music.";"Let’s take it from the top
	At the head of the table is the all-new Cerotar 28mm precision-coated soft-dome tweeter. And it’s one of our most sophisticated yet.

	Our engineers plundered some of our most celebrated technologies – including ingenious airflow systems from the award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter, the precision coating found on the Contour range and the Hexis from the new Confidence series (more on that in a bit) – and combined them into a new design specifically for the Evoke family.

	The Cerotar is driven by a newly-designed strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system, and features the Confidence’s headline-grabbing Hexis inner dome. This ingenious little dimpled device sits right behind the soft tweeter diaphragm and reduces unwanted resonances while smoothing out the overall frequency response. The result is sweeter treble, better detail and even more clarity – and that means you can listen into the wee hours of the morning without fatigue.

	The low-down on woofers
	Evoke 30’s twin 14cm Esotec+ mid/bass drivers are made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a material we’ve been using for our woofer diaphragms since Dynaudio started back in 1977. It provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to balance the needs of powerful yet precise bass performance with clear, detailed midrange.

	Each speaker cone is made from a single piece of MSP. This makes them exactly the right amount of rigid – and means far less physical distortion when they’re playing. It also gives a super-solid physical connection to the glass-fibre voice-coil former on the back (it’s glued directly under the Balance Ribs you’ll see around the centre), which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm.

	Evoke 30's 52mm voice-coils are made from aluminium – which provides the correct mix of weight and winding height to balance bass and midrange frequencies. It gives optimum moving mass while retaining the right grip of midrange performance for a perfectly integrated performance.

	Nomex spiders keep everything centred and moving the way it should, while the new Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater punch. And, like the Cerotar tweeter, Evoke 30’s woofers are both driven by ceramic Ferrite+ magnets for greater control, finesse and power.

	In non-speaker-designer language, that means “you’ll hear your music the way it was meant to be heard”. No rough edges, nothing standing out where it shouldn’t – and nothing relegated to a supporting act when it should be headlining.

	Timeless Danish design
	Evoke has been created for real life. Our designers’ priority was to make the whole family look great in any listening environment. They took models and prototypes home and sat with them, went and scoured interior-design stores and specialist furniture retailers and even sniffed around real houses to gain inspiration.

	Evoke 30 is available in four fantastic finishes. Black High Gloss and White High Gloss both use a new lacquering technique that gives a gloriously deep, glass-like look. At the other end of the tactile spectrum are the lovely, natural open veneers of Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood – honest, organic and hygge.

	The result is an instant classic. It’s modern, retro, timeless and cutting-edge all at once. It’s the kind of speaker your kids will eye-up expectantly when they’re leaving for university.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/1/Evoke30RevisiAC.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/2/FEATURESEVOKE30.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/3/g345EV30BG-F.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1977/4/g345EV30BG-B.jpg

2248;Gryphon Diablo 120 Integrated Amplifier Made in Denmark; IDR136.000.000,00 ; IDR-   ;hot;0;"Integrated Greatness

The understated styling and forceful lines of the satin black, brushed aluminium chassis and gleaming black acrylic faceplate represent a superb level of fit and finish, exceptional audio finesse and a sense of unlimited power all on a single chassis.

The casework, consisting of interlocking blocks of flawless acrylic and deeply brushed and anodized aluminium, is true to the acclaimed Gryphon house style, a complex construct of contrasting angles and planes that is both reassuringly intricate and impressively solid.

Built entirely at Gryphon’s Danish research and development and manufacturing facility, the Diablo 120 inherits the dual-mono circuitry, ultra-short signal path, heavily gold-plated printed circuit boards, minimal internal wiring, high-quality gold-plated and PTFE-insulated sockets and proprietary binding posts employed in our flagship models. Only the finest audiophile grade components have been selected based on strenuous, extended auditioning for sound quality, thermal stability and long-term reliability. The wire-wound emitter resistors in the original Atilla output stage have been upgraded to non-inductive types for Diablo 120.

The meticulous attention to electrical and mechanical grounding, typical of our top of the line designs, is also equally in evidence here.

The Diablo 120 integrated amplifier is essentially two independent mono devices for reduced crosstalk and minimal interchannel interaction. The only things shared electrically between channels are the famed Holmgren toroidal transformer and AC power cable.

The custom made 1,300 VA transformer adds substantial heft with discrete secondary windings for left and right channels. Each channel is fed by its own 60,000 µF capacitor bank.

The output power of the Diablo 120 is 20% greater than that of the original Atilla: 2 x 120 W (8Ω), 2 x 240 W (4Ω), 2 x 440 W (2Ω). Consistent increases of output power as impedance is halved is a reliable indicator of exceptional high current capability, just as the extraordinary wide audio bandwidth, 0.1Hz to 250 kHz (-3 dB), is a sign of extreme stability. Heatsink surface area has also been increased to match the increase in output power.

With two pairs of Sanken transistors, Diablo 120 can easily drive difficult loudspeaker loads without the faintest hint of strain.

The Diablo 120 circuit employs zero global negative feedback and a unique microprocessor controlled passive attenuator for the most transparent volume control ever conceived. Regardless of the selected level, the 46-step relay attenuator places maximum six resistors in the signal path for ultimate sonic purity.

A large, graphical vacuum fluorescent display is employed instead of a more conventional LED character display to provide space for more information and a larger, more easily legible font. The lavish display and extensive control circuits are powered independently via a separate, isolated transformer in order to eliminate any risk of noise contamination. All front panel controls are touch sensitive (capacitive actuation.)

The Diablo 120 offers one balanced and four single-ended inputs, a comprehensive menu of configuration options (four levels of display brightness, user-defined start and maximum volume settings, individual source labelling with eight-character names and a dedicated and electrically isolated A/V bypass function for uncompromising integration with a multi-channel audio system.";"Integrated Greatness

Form and function come together as the non-magnetic, non-resonant chassis and isolated power supplies for pre and power stages and control and display functions shield against interference.

The Gryphon Diablo 300 is controlled via an intuitively simple touch-sensitive front panel user interface and a software-based menu display that allow the owner to customise key functions. Future software updates can be installed via flash memory as they are developed.

A large alphanumeric Vacuum Fluorescent Display prominently exhibits the name of the active input and the current volume setting. Personalised input source names up to eight characters long can be assigned in the display.

All functions are accessible from the front panel or the striking remote wand. So there are no mechanical parts to wear out or become noisy.

In the words of HiFi+ (UK):";"Fortunately, in designing the Diablo 300, the Gryphon crew had the luxury and privilege of being able to draw heavily on concepts, components and technological breakthroughs that emerged during the evolution of the much lauded Gryphon Pandora preamplifier and Mephisto power amplifier.

	The ultra-transparent, fully balanced volume attenuator topology fully exploits the two balanced inputs. Unlike the vast majority of solid state volume controls that typically introduce dozens of resistors in the signal path, the Diablo 300 employs no more than two for any given level setting.

	The extreme wideband frequency response of the Diablo 300 extends from 0.5 Hz to 350 kHz and its prodigious 300 Watt (8 Ohms) power output capability represents a significant increase over the original Diablo. The extreme high current capability of the Diablo 300 allows it to double its output to 600 Watts in a 4 Ohm load and deliver a massive 950 Watts into 2 Ohms.

	As these numbers confirm, the Gryphon Diablo 300 will remain rock solid when confronted with even the most viciously reactive loudspeaker loads.

	Diablo 300 maintains a power reservoir capacity of 68,000 microFarad and employs local active shunt regulators for superior noise suppression compared to the Zener diode regulated low-voltage supplies of the original Diablo.

	Because it operates without negative feedback, the Gryphon Diablo 300 avoids both the intrinsic time-delay caused by sending the output signal to the input for a comparator loop and the resulting intermodulation distortion between time-offset signals.
	
	Vinyl Digital Option
	
		At the time of original purchase or as the need arises at a later date, Gryphon Diablo 300 can be fitted with a specially designed Gryphon DAC PCM/DSD module based on the innovative, award-winning Gryphon Kalliope digital-to- analogue converter. The module adds five digital inputs (USB, balanced AES 115 Ω, optical and dual S/PDIF 75 Ω). USB can process PCM up to 32-bit/384 kHz as well as DSD (Windows OS up to DSD512, Mac OS up to DSD128, Linux OS up to DSD128 DoP).
	
		The remaining digital connections can handle PCM up to 24-bit/192 kHz.
	
		 
	
		This future-proof digital module is ready for any current or foreseeable high resolution digital format.
	
		And, in the finest Gryphon tradition, the Diablo 300 offers the option of an exceptional MM/MC phonostage for the dedicated enthusiasts who continue to enjoy the musical treasures etched in the grooves of the long-playing, black vinyl disc.
		
		Style and Easy to Use
		
			Despite its substantial size and heft, the satin black, brushed aluminium chassis and gleaming black acrylic faceplate of the Gryphon Diablo 300 exude luxurious elegance that will enhance any interior. Form and function come together as the non-magnetic, non-resonant chassis and isolated power supplies for pre and power stages and control and display functions shield against interference.
		
			The Gryphon Diablo 300 is controlled via an intuitively simple touch-sensitive front panel user interface and a software-based menu display that allow the owner to customise key functions. Future software updates can be installed via flash memory as they are developed.
		
			A large alphanumeric Vacuum Fluorescent Display prominently exhibits the name of the active input and the current volume setting. Personalised input source names up to eight characters long can be assigned in the display.
		
			All functions are accessible from the front panel or the striking remote wand. So there are no mechanical parts to wear out or become noisy.

Digital Integrity

Based on comprehensive listening sessions in the quest for the best available digital-to-analog conversion technology without regard to cost or other extraneous considerations, Gryphon Scorpio employs an Asahi Kasei Microsystems Delta-Sigma DAC from the acclaimed designers of the world’s finest professional A-to-D and D-to-A converters.

The advanced DAC at the heart of the Gryphon Scorpio makes a major contribution to the player’s effortlessly natural rendering of a three-dimensional soundscape with exceptional timing and razor-shape detail.

In the interest of extracting the purest, most unadulterated sound possible, timing issues are addressed with two independent, specially designed, temperature-compensated crystal oscillators accurate to better than five parts per million.

Gryphon’s pioneering upsampling technology significantly reduces filter demands on the analogue side of the D/A converter by shifting the spectrum of quantization noise (aliasing) up and away from the range in which it is most detrimental, so that the upper corner frequency of the digital anti-aliasing filter is more than four times that of the standard 44.1 kHz sample rate..

Despite claims made by some manufacturers, upsampling can neither miraculously restore lost information nor generate new information from the original 44.1 kHz source. What properly implemented upsampling can do is eliminate the need for conventional, steep-slope analogue filtering altogether.

In the Gryphon Scorpio, this filter is replaced by a single, silvered Mica capacitor acting as a simple, first-order analogue output filter, preserving the integrity of the audio signal for a pristine presentation staged against an utterly silent, “black” backdrop with a noise floor well below that of the recording itself.

Gryphon Scorpio executes the filter function benignly in the digital domain by employing asynchronous 32-bit/192 kHz sample rate conversion originally introduced in the digital reference standard Gryphon Mikado Signature to ensure greater resolution of fine detail, sharper image focus and extended high-frequency response.

By executing the filter function benignly in the digital domain with asynchronous 32-bit/192 kHz sample rate conversion originally introduced in the digital reference standard Gryphon Mikado Signature CD player, Gryphon Scorpio achieves extraordinary resolution of fine detail, sharp image focus and extended high-frequency response.

Designed as a fitting mate for the potent Gryphon Diablo and Atilla integrated amplifiers, Gryphon Scorpio will stand as an attractive addition to any living space. The front vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) with four lines of 20 characters provides a practical instant overview of disc and player status.

The fine, European transport mechanism is specially constructed for silent running and effective vibration damping. The stylish feel and look of the sandblasted, anodised aluminium disc tray conveys the reliability and stability of this rock-steady, precisely calibrated mechanism.

Perfectly attuned to each other, they allow music to be played back in outstanding quality. So that all components can work without interference, just like sensitive measuring equipment they need to be kept free of vibrations and shocks as far as possible. Vibrations are caused in different ways and they can be transmitted by structure-borne and airborne noise. The absorbers provide a remedy here. The Excellence Gel Absorbers have a special gel mixture at their core that can take up, i.e. absorb, vibration energy. They decouple loudspeakers and devices from the surface on which they are standing. You could say that it is sufficient to decouple the loudspeakers. But, as described above, there is still air-borne noise that also acts on the surface on which the devices are standing. So it therefore makes sense to decouple all of the devices from the surfaces on which they are standing. The same applies to devices such as CD players or hard drives that produce mechanical vibrations themselves and need to be kept away from other components as far as this is possible.

However, due to the low loudspeaker impedances low line resistances and low inductance are also very important for loudspeaker cables. For this reason, a total of 6 concentric copper conductors are used in the REFERENCE LS-204 XL MICRO AIR in addition to the air dielectric. Thanks to this multicore architecture, the magnetic fields of the positive and negative conductors overlap and neutralise each other. This reduces the inductance of the cable considerably, thereby guaranteeing unadulterated transmission of the audio signal over a broad frequency range.;"We are continuing the story of AIR technology with the new REFERENCE MICRO AIR series: As with the already legendary AIR Helix cables, air is a central component of the insulation concept in the new REFERENCE MICRO AIR technology.

Perfectly attuned to each other, they allow music to be played back in outstanding quality. So that all components can work without interference, just like sensitive measuring equipment they need to be kept free of vibrations and shocks as far as possible. Vibrations are caused in different ways and they can be transmitted by structure-borne and air-borne noise. The combination of air-borne and structure-borne noise causes all of the components of the hi-fi system to vibrate mechanically. Experiments have shown that this is a considerable impact on the sound. The Reference Hightech Gel Absorbers from in-akustik form a solid sound basis that is available as a combination set for all weight classes. They have a special gel at their core that absorbs vibrations.

	in-akustik is an official partner of the HDMI® Licensing, LLC.
	
	Previously, the customer has hardly been able to tell whether a cable really is an HDMI® conform product. There was never any option of checking for HDMI® certified products, for example on the internet. The huge variety on offer makes it very difficult for HDMI® Licensing LLC to check adherence to specified guidelines. HDMI® Licensing LLC has now developed its own certification – the “Approved HDMI® Associate Program”.

	in-akustik is an official partner of the HDMI® Licensing, LLC.
	
	Previously, the customer has hardly been able to tell whether a cable really is an HDMI® conform product. There was never any option of checking for HDMI® certified products, for example on   the internet. The huge variety on offer makes it very difficult for HDMI® Licensing LLC to check adherence to specified guidelines. HDMI® Licensing LLC has now developed its own certification – the “Approved HDMI® Associate Program”. This provides consumers with the required transparency and enables them to check the HDMI® conformity of a given product at a glance. All certified products are now labelled with the official “Approved HDMI® Associate” logo. As partner of the “Associate Program”, in-akustik is obliged to undergo one of the HDMI® Licensing LLC conformity tests for all HDMI® cables every year.

	Whatever Your Flavor

	Whether your looking for a voice monitor for your recently re-grouped band, your newly opened karaoke bar, or to communicate on a new level with your neighbor, the RM10 has you covered. With its 50 to 400-Watt power rating, your sure to be heard whatever the situation.

	Hear It Loud And Clear

	A loudspeaker system is nothing more than the sum of its components and JBL engineers employ only cutting-edge technologies. They certainly didn't hold back with the RM10 vocal monitor. Featuring a low diffraction IsoPower baffle, dual FreeFlow flared ports, and Straight-Line Signal Path, rest assured you'll have good, clear sound. Plus both the dual 3-inch tweeters and the 10-inch woofer are backed by high-temperature voice coils. And the tweeters have the added advantage of protection circuitry that keeps the tweeter intact under adverse conditions—such as when your aunt Martha belts out ""Nothing Compares 2 U.""

	Cut It Out (The Distortion, That Is)

	The RM10 monitor is equipped with left and right high-frequency trim controls that control the tweeters in the left and right side panels of each RM10 speaker. The trim controls enable you to compensate for various room conditions and vocal styles: adjust the trim controls so that the vocals are loud enough to be intelligible without being so loud as to be harsh or distorted.

		Born from JL Audio’s vast collection of advanced technologies, Dominion™ powered subwoofers combine a state-of-the-art subwoofer driver and an advanced Class D amplifier to deliver unmatched performance and value for a wide variety of compact applications.
	
		Purpose-built to reproduce powerful low-frequency events with stunning impact and precision, the Dominion™ driver employs JL Audio’s exclusive DMA (Dynamic Motor Analysis) technology to produce higher output levels with reduced distortion, as well as improved dynamic tracking and resolution. As a result, Dominion™ subwoofers are capable of peak-to-peak excursions well in excess of 2.5-inches (63 mm - d108), and 2.7 inches (68 mm – d110), without distress or audible distortion.
	
		Dominion™ amplifiers utilize an advanced Class D design in order to extract the most from the long-excursion driver platform. This design features a tightly regulated switching power supply, allowing the amplifier to generate prodigious amounts of unclipped output voltages. These technologies ensure that the Dominion™ powered subwoofers remain in their comfort zone, which is well beyond the point where most small subwoofers run out of power or driver capability.
	
		With a host of signal processing features included, Dominion™ powered subwoofers can be integrated into most systems with ease. Low-pass signals are precisely guided, thanks to the onboard crossover’s 24 dB/octave Linkwitz-Riley alignment. Phase and polarity controls are onboard to aid in achieving the optimal acoustic transition between the subwoofer(s) and main speakers. Flexible input options are on-hand to accept either line-level or speaker-level signals. Connect a JLINK™ TRX system (sold separately) to the onboard Wireless Link port and enjoy the freedom to position your Dominion™ almost anywhere, up to 100 feet (30 meters) away from your source unit.
	
		To contain the immense pressures created by the Dominion™ driver, each beautiful cabinet is carefully engineered and constructed using solid, CNC-cut, MDF material with extensive internal bracing and advanced assembly techniques. All Dominion™ powered subwoofers are built with pride and precision in JL Audio’s U.S. factory to deliver years of listening enjoyment.

			The E-Sub subwoofer driver features a radical, deep architecture designed to create a highly linear, mechanical action and a motor design with enough linear excursion to handle the most challenging program material.
		
			A totally new switching amplifier was engineered for the E-Subs, with a compact and efficient switching power supply. This design allows us to keep the E-Sub's dimensions compact while delivering ample clean power that will fully exercise the drivers' excursion ranges.
		
			The E-Sub's feature set has been designed to allow the use of E-Subs in a wide range of applications, from full home theater systems to dedicated two-channel music systems, to desktop audio workstations. A true, two-way onboard crossover with high-pass line outputs allows the E-Sub to integrate seamlessly with two-channel systems, and high-level inputs even make it possible to add an E-Sub to systems lacking line outputs. Polarity and variable phase controls make it possible to precisely blend the E-Sub's output with that of your main speakers.
		
			Every E-Sub is precision-built in JL Audio's U.S. factory and individually performance-verified and tested to deliver years of listening enjoyment in your home audio or home theater system.

		Powered Subwoofer with 12-inch Subwoofer Driver, 1500 watts
	
	
		Applying a series of our key technologies, E-Sub powered subwoofers deliver exceptional sound quality, power and value in a wide range of demanding applications
	
		E-Sub drivers employ our exclusive DMA technology to optimize the drivers' motor strength, ensuring linear behavior over a very long excursion range. Unlike typical steady-state modeling systems, DMA takes into account the dynamic shifts created by current flow and back EMF under real power conditions, with real program material. The payoff offered by DMA optimization is a driver that faithfully tracks its input signal, at all listening levels, leading to superior bass definition and dynamics.
	
		The extreme mounting depth of the E-Sub driver is very deliberate. It permits wide gaps to exist between the three suspension elements (the rubber surround and the dual spiders), imparting exceptional mechanical stability over the driver's full excursion range. This further improves linearity, reduces distortion and enhances long-term reliability. In a stroke of engineering elegance, the E-Sub’s steel front mounting flange forms the entire front baffle of the finished product, while the driver’s back-plate is threaded and bolted to the rear wall of its enclosure for support.
	
		To power these innovative drivers, we engineered a completely new switching amplifier with a regulated, switching power supply, making its chassis more compact, lightweight and efficient, while still delivering ample, clean power to fully exercise the E-Sub driver's performance envelope.
	
		Conveniently controlled from the E-Sub cabinet’s top panel, the amplifier incorporates studio-grade signal processing to make adjustments a much more enjoyable experience than rear–mounted controls found on most powered subwoofers. An attractive cover hides and protects the controls during normal use.
	
		The feature set has been designed to allow the use of E-Subs in a wide range of applications, from full home theater systems to dedicated two-channel music systems, to desktop audio workstations. Analog inputs are provided for unbalanced line-level signals or speaker level signals. Dedicated line outputs are included to make a bi-amped system arrangement with no additional hardware required. Useful in combating ground-related noise problems, a rear panel switch configures the line level inputs as grounded or isolated.
	
		The E-Sub’s active crossover is a true two-way, 4th order Linkwitz-Riley design, with a low-pass filter feeding the subwoofer's amplifier and a high-pass filtered signal exiting its line outputs. When the on-board crossover is defeated, as is typical in a home theater installation, the line outputs deliver a pass-through, buffered signal identical to its line inputs, easily permitting multiple E-Subs to be interconnected in a ‘daisy-chain' arrangement. Switchable polarity and a fully variable phase control round out the signal processing section. All signal processing is performed in the analog domain, ensuring very low latency in critical applications.
	
		Precision-built in JL Audio's U.S. factory, all E-Sub are individually performance-verified and tested to deliver years of listening enjoyment in your home audio or home theater system.

							""Sit anywhere"" Uni-Q Sound
							
							At the heart of the evolved Q Series is the Uni-Q driver array. KEF's signature innovation places the tweeter in the acoustic center of the midrange cone, bringing the acoustic ideal of a single point source closer than ever to realisation. The result is a more detailed, more accurate three-dimensional sound image, which is dispersed more evenly throughout the room than is possible with a conventional speaker. Uni-Q's ultra-wide dispersion is further enhanced by KEF's 'tangerine' waveguide over the tweeter dome.
						
							
					
				
			
			
				
					
						
							
						
							Uni-Q sound taken to the next level
							
							The closed box midrange cabinet design reduces the load on the Uni-Q midrange cone, increasing clarity and detail while delivering cleaner, punchier bass.
							
							With the addition of the Damped tweeter loading tube providing a gentle termination of sound produced from the back of the tweeter, lower treble performance is improved dramatically and a new low-distortion inductor on the crossover provides cleaner bass response.
					
				
			
			
				
					
						
							Redesigned Bass Drivers
							
							Low-frequency (LF) drivers now have a larger roll surround, along with a new spider suspension to produce cleaner bass at high volumes. A new cone structure improves midrange clarity, and an enhanced Auxiliary Bass Radiators (ABRs) with a new surround and rear suspension delivers better controlled and more impressive bass.

	CELEBRATING 70 LEGENDARY YEARS
	In celebration of Klipsch 70th anniversary, exclusive limited-edition Klipschorn speaker are being manufactured in exotic Australian Walnut wood veneer. Australian Wwalnut (also known as Queensland Walnut) is grown in the coastal tablelands of North Queensland, Australia. The species varies in color, but is usually a pale-golden hue highly contrasted with darker steakes of chocolate brown, grey, black, or even pink. Australian Wwalnut grain is moderately close and even, and sometime wavy, resulting in a wide variety of figure effects.
	
	DESIGNED AND MADE IN THE USA
	As the only speaker in the world to be in continuous production for over 70 years, the Klipschorn has remained relatively unchanged since its inception. Remember great sound? We do, too. The Klipschorn enclosure is still made in the USA, by proud craftsmen in Hope, Arkansas. Just like Paul W.Klipsch intended
	
	
	FEATURES:
	CORNER-HORN SPEAKER
	As the only loudspeaker in the world to be continuously produced for 70 years, the Klipschorn has truly stood the test of time.

This gives each speaker a more aesthetically appealing and consistent appearance that is treasured more than any other cut of wood veneer.
	
	MATCHED PAIRS
	Each pair of Forte III Loudspeakers is grain matched using wood veneers panels that come from the same timber. Each cabinet is carefully matched so that each speaker in the pair is practically indistinguishable from the other. The speakers move seamlessly together through the factory.

				HYBRID TRACTRIX® HORN TECHNOLOGY
			
				
					Klipsch proprietary Tractrix® horn loading technology ensures high-frequency energy of the Reference Premiere series speakers is aimed directly at the listener and reduces unwanted, artificial reverb caused by indirect sound bouncing off walls - meaning you experience the most clear, detailed, lifelike sound possible.
				
					 
				
					
						
							HORN ANATOMY
						
							
								Klipsch Reference Premiere series speakers feature a compressed molded silicon face thats matted to the 90x90 Tractrix horn to reduces horn resonance for a smoother frequency response. Klipsch computer modeled phase plugs acts as a mechanical filter to further ensure a smooth, flat frequency response while protecting the tweeter from damage.
							
								 
							
								
									
										ALL-NEW Vented Tweeter
									
										
											A vented tweeter design reduces standing waves behind the tweeter diaphragm for a smoother high frequency reproduction.
										
											The titanium tweeter diaphragm's light weight yet rigid composition exceeds the performance of aluminum, polymer or silk tweeters.
										
											Klipsch award-winning Linear Travel Suspension technology leverages a piston motion of the titanium diaphragm that lowers distortion and delivers real-to-life sound.
										
											A ceramic magnet housing provides premium performance, Klipsch Reference Premiere tweeters set the standard in acoustic reproduction.
										
											 
										
											
												
													CERAMETALLIC™ WOOFERS
												
													
														Klipsch proprietary Cerametallic™ woofers are the Reference Premiere series signature statement for both sound and aesthetics. This extremely light, rigid materials holds its shape while being able to deliver lower frequencies with maximum efficiency.
													
														 
													
														
															
																WOOFER ANATOMY
															
																
																	Klipsch Cerametallic™ cones are matted to a dual-layer, copper-wound voice coil for exceptional conductivity.
																
																	Reference Premiere woofers are housed in a non-resonating, stamped-steel basket that’s secured to a large magnet motor for exceptional efficiency and low distortion, and matched to our horn-loaded tweeters for optimal acoustic execution.

	DESIGNED AND MADE IN THE USA USING DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED COMPONENTS The Klipsch RF-7 III speaker is a testament to the quality that Klipsch demands from each and every one of its audio products. Remember great sound? We do, too. The RF-7 III enclosure is made in the USA, by proud craftsmen in Hope, Arkansas. Just like Paul W. Klipsch (PWK) intended. NEW 1 3 /4 TITANIUM DIAPHRAGM COMPRESSION DRIVER The compression driver features a new phase plug design to improve phase coherency at the throat of the horn, resulting in improved sound pressure linearity at high frequencies. 90° x 90° TRACTRIX® HORN The redesigned Tractrix Horn utilizes a circular horn throat paired to a square horn mouth to further improve high-frequency response and extension, while enhancing imaging and dynamics. The compressed molded rubber construction adds high frequency damping to reduce harshness and improve detail. This creates the cleanest, most natural sound possible. SPUN COPPER CERAMETALLIC WOOFERS™ Cerametallic woofers represent the pinnacle of Klipsch driver design, maintaining exceptional rigidity, and lightweight construction, for minimal cone breakup and distortion. When paired with the Tractrix horn-loaded compression driver, it provides speaker efficiency highest in its class. NEW TRACTRIX® PORT Utilizing Tractrix geometry, the new RF-7 III ports allow for the most efficient air transfer from the cabinet — for the cleanest, most powerful low frequency response on the market. DUAL CHAMBERED ENCLOSURE DESIGN The new bifurcated enclosure allows each 10” driver and port to work independently from the other. This improves the linearity of both drive systems, and minimizes standing wave problems inside the cabinet that can cause frequency anomalies in the sensitive midrange frequencies. CAST FRAME WOOFER DESIGN Each 10” woofer feature a heavy-duty cast aluminum frame for resonant-free operation. In addition, each woofer incorporates a dual shorting-ring magnet structure design to eliminate modulation of the magnetic flux resulting in improved linearity of cone movement. FURNITURE GRADE WOOD VENEERS RF-7 III enclosures all utilize furniture grade wood veneers, and are available in Black Ash, Cherry & Walnut.

	The A3 enclosure is formed with machined 6061 T6 aircraft grade aluminum and includes a complex internal bracing structure that increases the stiffness and mass of the enclosure while minimizing overall resonance. A calibrated sub-enclosure provides an optimized environment for the midrange driver to operate within and without any interaction from the back wave pressure of the bass drivers. The black brushed aluminum enclosure is lustrous and stands firmly on a 4-point spiked outrigger base which provides perfect coupling to the floor for enhanced dynamic range.
	
	Extended high frequencies are provided by a newly designed Magico pure beryllium-diaphragm with an optimized 28-mm dome surface that is based on the fundamental design platform of the M-Project tweeter. A customized neodymium motor system is encased in an improved back chamber with new damping materials which provide ultra-low distortion, higher power handling, massive dynamic capabilities and extended linear voice coil movement.
	A newly designed Magico 6-inch midrange driver sets a new benchmark of measured performance in both frequency bandwidth and time domains. The cone material is formulated using Multi-Wall carbon fiber and a layer of XG Nanographene, which provides optimal stiffness to weight ratio with ideal damping properties. A new overhung neodymium based motor system incorporates extra-large magnets to ensure a stabilized magnetic field in the 75-mm pure titanium voice coil.

One more thing: the CD6006 features a newly developed, complex headphone amplifier with headphone amp gain setting for a wider range of headphones.
						
							Marantz HDAM Technology
							Marantz developed its own discrete circuit boards to replace standard IC's. These HDAM's consists of discrete surface mount components with short mirror image L/R signal paths. Those devices are doing exactly the same thing as the Op-Amps, but outperform the regular IC Op-amps dramatically in terms of the Slew Rate and reduced noise level, resulting in a much more dynamic, accurate and detailed sound. Over the years Marantz developed different types of the HDAM to improve quality and to fit to the special requirements of a product category like CD or amplifier.
						
							High Current Power Supply
							The audio power supply employs high speed, high current Shottky Barrier Diodes and high current storage capacitors.
						
							Reference Quality D/A Conversion
							The CD6006 features high resolution D/A conversion and is equipped with the reference class CS4398 D/A converter, which provides up to 192 kHz/24 bit resolution for optimum fidelity with high resolution audio file types.
						
							High slew rate op-amp + HDAM-SA2 headphone amplifier with headphone amp gain setting (Low/Mid/High)
							The headphone amplifier section features our HDAM-SA2 circuit with three gain settings (Low/Mid/High) for a wider range of headphones.
						
							Plays USB audio sources (MP3/WMA/AAC/WAV) / ""Made for iPod/iPhone""
							The CD6006 can play back MP3, WMA, WAV and AAC files from a connected USB storage device. It is also specifically ""Made for iPod/iPhone"", to directly play back your iDevice music through the CD Player's high quality D/A converters.

					Best European Stereo System 2016-2017
				
					“High quality stereo separates are this company’s mainstay, its 6000 series being first launched some six years ago. This latest iteration of amplifier and CD player sees both components share a tried-and-tested 192kHz/24-bit DAC, upstream from its custom HDAM audio stages, as used across the Marantz range. While the CD6006 now boasts specially selected components and a reworked circuit layout, the PM6006 gains an optical digital input and a beefier design better suited to driving a wider range of loudspeakers. If you’re seeking the high-end Marantz sound at a bargain price, this combination’s supremely polished, yet powerful performance won’t disappoint.”

					The Complete Digital Music Source Player
				
				
					The ND8006 is built to meet all the requirements of the modern digital music listener, bringing together functions usually requiring two or three separate audio components. Based on the successful NA8005 and SA8005 models, but featuring a complete re-think of features and audio design, it combines a CD player with a digital sources hub offering playback from home network, local USB storage, online sources such as streaming services and Internet radio, HEOS support and DAC functionality allowing the direct connection of computers and other devices. It’s also futureproofed, accepting file formats all the way up to 11.2Mhz quad-DSD and 384kHz/32-bit PCM, and additionally features both Apple AirPlay 2 and Bluetooth to play music from portable devices.
				
		
		
			
				
					HEOS music streaming
				
				
					The ND8006’s built-in HEOS technology allows you to stream and play back your favourite music wirelessly from literally unlimited sources. Enjoy music from Spotify, TuneIn Internet radio, Sound Cloud, Tidal, Napster, Deezer, or your local music file libraries. With additional HEOS components like the HEOS speaker range or other HEOS-capable receivers, you can play all your music throughout the whole house. Control it all effortlessly with the free HEOS app.
			
		
		
			
				
					High Resolution Audio
				
				
					Optical and coaxial digital inputs as well as a USB-B port enable you to stream music directly from a PC or MAC, or connect other digital sources. The USB-B works in asynchronous mode to support not only 384kHz/32bits high-resolution audio but also the DSD 2.8MHz, 5.6MHz and even 11.2MHz formats for maximized performance and the most direct way to enjoy excellent quality. To safeguard quality when connected to a computer, Marantz built extended isolation around the USB-B input to eliminate the chance of high frequency noise generated by the computer entering the ND8006. Furthermore, the front USB port accepts USB thumb or hard drives for standard music file playback.
			
		
		
			
				
					Marantz Musical Digital Filtering (MMDF)
				
				
					The ND8006 features the unique Marantz Musical Digital Filtering (MMDF), inspired by our audiophile reference class technology. For Marantz, using standard digital filter solutions is not an option, as this filtering is crucial to the sound reproduction of digital input signals. As a result, we invested extensively in gaining expert knowledge, leading into highly-acclaimed Marantz Music Mastering technology used in award-winning Premium Range 10 Series products. Adapted for the ND8006 hardware design, the solution is called Marantz Musical Digital Filtering. Two selectable, digital filter characteristics cater for different tastes, and each handle even the minutest of detail with loving care in the digital audio signal, transforming new media files into the finest of high-resolution playback.
			
		
		
			
				
					Heos, Built-in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and AirPlay 2 Capability
				
				
					Featuring Bluetooth & Wi-Fi wireless streaming connectivity, the ND8006 is equipped with an advanced dual antenna transceiver system, for robust streaming even in congested urban environments. With Apple's AirPlay 2 compatibility, you can enjoy listening to your favourite tracks wirelessly from your favourite iOS device such as iPhone and iPad.
				
					  
			
		
		
			
				
					Preserving sound quality
				
				
					The individual “OFF mode” setting allows unused sections of the ND8006 to be switched off to avoid any chance of interference, and to keep the audio source signal paths in use as pure as possible for further improved sound quality. The shielded toroidal transformer further minimises internal noise while the rigid, double-layer chassis cares for optimal shielding and stability.
			
		
		
			
				
					Audiophile D/A conversion and unique Marantz HDAM
				
				
					The ND8006 is built with legendary Marantz sound quality commitment. The audiophile ESS9016 Sabre DAC, with dual crystal clocks ensures accurate handling of all digital signals. The analogue circuitry uses carefully selected components plus the famous Marantz Hyper-Dynamic Amplifier Modules (HDAMs) resulting in wide dynamic range and lowest distortion: in place of the all-in-one ‘chip amplifiers’ used elsewhere, these miniature amplifiers are built from separate, optimised components for the very best sound quality, and are found in Marantz products all the way up to the Reference series players and amplifiers.
			
		
		
			
				
					High quality headphone output
				
				
					For music lovers enjoying their favourite recording directly via headphones the ND8006 features a high-quality headphone stage with dedicated amplifier module HDAM-SA2. To work with a wider variety of headphones, the gain factor can be changed from low to mid to high. By using this, it is possible to drive low to high impedance headphone without any problem.
			
		
		
			
				
					Independent Variable output terminal
				
				
					Alongside its conventional line output for use into an amplifier like the perfectly matching PM8006, the ND8006 provides a separate variable level output for connection to powered or active speakers, or to a power amp direct input, allowing it to be used as a multi-source digital player/preamp. The volume can also be controlled via apps or by using the remote handset.

					Current Feedback
				
				
					Current Feedback amplification is a well-known, Marantz-original circuit technology, thoughtfully designed to match the requirements of Super Audio hi-res music for wide-bandwidth, high-speed reproduction. The impedance at the Current Feedback point is limited, generating a very low phase shift. Marantz Current Feedback amplifiers reduce the need for phase compensation by minimizing Negative Feedback (NFB). This simplifies the signal path and results in a high through-rate, excellent transient response and superb sonic transparency across the full bandwidth. Unlike conventional Voltage Feedback topology, Current Feedback also makes the power amplifier insensitive to difficult loudspeaker loads.
			
		
		
			
				
					Marantz HDAM Technology
				
				
					Marantz developed its own discrete circuit boards called Hyper-Dynamic Amplifier Modules, or HDAMs, to replace the chip based amps used elsewhere. Using discrete surface mount components with short mirror-image left and right signal paths, HDAMs outperform the regular integrated Op-amps dramatically in Slew Rate and noise level. The result is much more dynamic, accurate and detailed sound. Over the years, Marantz has developed different HDAMs to fit the particular requirements of players and amplifiers. The PM8006 uses the high-grade SA3 version.
			
		
		
			
				
					Marantz Musical Phono EQ
				
				
					For a long time, Marantz integrated amplifiers have featured high-quality phono stages. We’ve elevated our commitment to vinyl with the Marantz Musical Phono EQ stage, as seen in the PM8006 amplifier. Enjoy the very best playback of all music sources, be they digital or analog. Marantz Musical Phono EQ uses two-stage amplification, allowing less gain per stage for lower distortion. The PM8006 combines Marantz HDAM technology with JFETs (junction gate field-effect transistors) in the input stage, providing high input impedance that eliminates the need for AC coupling capacitors and simplifies the signal path, vastly improving the signal purity overall.
					
					Marantz rethought the re-equalization process within the phono stage, splitting it into passive and active sections for more accurate equalization. The RIAA correction is carried out within an HDAM, while amplification is in the hands of a high-quality op-amp that runs in Class A mode for minimal distortion and clean, open sound. With Marantz Musical Phono EQ there’s no need to consider upgrading the PM8006 with offboard phono stage — the amplifier already includes premium-class phono capability for optimized playback of all formats.
			
		
		
			
				
					Toroidal Transformer
				
				
					A Toroidal transformer offers several advantages that derive from its efficiency and power capability. The shape of it lends to low levels of electromagnetic radiation and mechanical vibration, producing improved sound quality over what you might experience with dated transformer models.
			
		
		
			
				
					Often Under Estimated: High Quality Volume Control
				
				
					Newly developed electric volume control uses the latest volume control IC to realize better channel separation and dynamic range and distortion-reduction, while retaining the operational feel of an analog volume control device. The amplifier employs new Marantz-designed electric volume control for high linearity and best-in-class channel separation.
			
		
		
			
				
					High Quality, Original Marantz SPKT-1+ Speaker Terminals
				
				
					The terminals are made of massive brass with a thick silver plating, providing the best possible contact with speaker cables.

					Marantz Musical Premium Phono EQ
				
				
					Designed to deliver optimal sound quality by simplifying the signal path, the Marantz Musical Premium Phono EQ stage in the PM-KI-Ruby amplifier can be used with both moving magnet and low-output moving coil cartridges, thanks to a built-in MC head amplifier. Distortion is reduced by using two-stage amplification in the phono stage, and Marantz HDAMs are combined with JFETs (junction gate field effect transistors) in the input stage, giving high input impedance. The exclusion of coupling capacitors further simplifies the design, reducing signal distortion and enhances signal purity.

The amplifier output stage of the PM-KI Ruby allows a large power output, delivering 2x100W into an 8ohm load, and easily copes with high-impedance speakers thanks to a 2x200W output into 4ohms. The amplifier module connects directly to the rear panel PCB on the PM-KI Ruby to maintain signal purity and sound stability.
			
		
	


	

	 

	
		
			
				
					Pure Analog Design
				
				
					The purely analog design of the PM-KI Ruby contributes to its noise-reduction structure and clean build. Rather than build the DAC into the amplifier, which would add noise within the chassis, Marantz built the PM-KI Ruby without one and then implemented the DAC in the SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD Player. This eliminated interference with the delicate analog signals passing through the amp, maintaining an analog environment that’s as pure and clean as possible.
			
		
	


	
		
			
				
					Carefully Selected Components
				
				
					Marantz has a steadfast reputation for choosing the best-possible components for its Premium Series products. The Marantz alternative to the “amplifier on a chip” IC components, the HDAM, is a miniature amplifier module built entirely of discrete components. Marantz engineers selected and optimized the HDAM through extensive listening in dedicated Marantz facilities in Europe and Japan. Extensive, painstaking and meticulous tuning has long been the secret of exquisite-sounding Marantz amplifiers. During the development stage, every part is carefully selected, tested and validated by Marantz audio engineers to ensure audio perfection every time you listen.
				
					 
					
			
			
				
					Multiple Analog Inputs and Outputs
				
				
					In addition to phono and CD analog inputs, the PM-KI Ruby features two line-level inputs and two pairs of recorder input/output jacks that enable the connection of multiple sources and recorders. Use the PM-KI Ruby as a standalone stereo power amplifier for additional system configuration versatility with the included power amp input, or connect the PM-KI Ruby to an external power amplifier via the stereo pre-amp outputs.
				
					
					
			
		
	


	
		
			
				
					Dedicated Headphone Output
				
				
					Using Marantz-proprietary HDAM discrete modules, the headphone circuit delivers superb audio fidelity with the widest range of headphone types and impedances, including low impedance headphones.
				
					 
					
			
			
				
					System Remote Control
				
				
					Use the elegant remote control to operate the PM-KI Ruby as well as the complementary SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD Player. The PM-KI Ruby features remote control input and output jacks for additional remote control configuration flexibility.
				
					 
					
			
		
	


	Built to Perform


	Like the complementary SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD player, the PM-KI Ruby integrated amplifier is constructed to the highest standards with a copper-plated chasses to reduce mechanical and electrical interference. A front panel constructed from thick, heavy, non-magnetic aluminum panels and an 5mm dense aluminum top cover eliminate added interference. Nickel-plated copper independent input terminals for CD and Phono plus Marantz-original high-quality/high-purity copper-plated speaker terminals ensure the best signal possible.

	Amplifiers are at the core of Marantz history:
	its very first product was a high-quality preamplifier designed to make the most of the then-new LP record format. And with a history stretching all the way to that ground-breaking Audio Consolette – which Saul B Marantz started manufacturing in 1952, and which soon became the first real Marantz product, the Model 1 preamplifier – , it’s no surprise that the company’s very latest Premium Series model, the PM-10, is an integrated amplifier built to set new standards with all of today’s music formats.

	In fact, this massively powerful integrated amplifier is constructed more like a high-end separate preamplifier and a pair of monobloc power amps, but all in one beautifully finished case, designed both to maximise performance and create a strong visual statement.

	
		
			
				
					
				
					Making an integrated amplifier with dual monobloc design fitting in a normal size cabinet is made possible by the use of a stereo switching amplifier. Its aim? To reveal the maximum musical involvement from everything from LPs to the latest high-resolution audio files and beyond, and with all the power and control required to drive the most demanding loudspeakers, allowing them to perform at their best.
			
		
	




	
		Optimised design
	


	

	To achieve such quality, while still delivering class-leading power, means optimising each section of the amplifier for its task, just as would be done in a design using a separate preamplifier and monobloc power amps.

	Commonly, amplifiers use a single transformer, with separate power supply regulation for the preamplifier and power amplifier sections; the PM-10 takes things much further.

	

	A dual-mono design, it has separate power supplies for the preamplifier and each of the power amplifier channels, with one transformer dedicated to the preamp to ensure the delicate signals passing through that section of the amplifier aren’t affected by the demands of the high power output stages. There’s also a dedicated supply for the microprocessor controlling volume adjustment, input selection and so on, ensuring no noise from the control section finds its way in to the audio path.



	Pure analogue


	Another important part of the noise-reduction here is the fact that the PM-10 is a purely analogue amplifier: many rival designs are today including digital-to-analogue conversion, or adopting digital amplification and volume control, but the Marantz keeps things as clean and simple as possible with its highly-developed all-analogue design.

	Why? Well, though it may seem convenient to have a DAC in the amplifier, digital circuitry is, by its very nature, noisy (in the electrical sense) and can interfere with the delicate analogue signals passing through the amp. That’s why Marantz chooses to design its Premium Series range with any digital-to-analogue conversion in its Super Audio CD or network music players, keeping its amplifiers as pure and clean as possible.

	What’s more, to make the most of that purity of design, the PM-10 has also been designed with the option of working in ‘Purest Mode’: when engaged, this deactivates any superfluous circuits, giving the signal the cleanest possible path through the amplifier. There’s also a Power Amp Direct input, taking the signal straight from the input section to the power stage to let the unit work as a pure power amplifier.



	Fully balanced, from input to final power section


	The benefits of balanced audio layout have long been understood: unlike a conventional layout, one half of the signal path is in the ground plane of either an amplifier or a cable, balanced working uses two conductors or paths – one for positive, the other for negative – and an entirely separate ground to protect them.

	The benefit in cables is that any external interference will affect both positive and negative conductors, but since the signals they are carrying are the mirror image of each other, they will mutually cancel out any effect – which is why such cables are widely used in pro audio and studio applications, where sources of hum are common, and the longer cable runs involved makes them particularly prone to picking up interference.

	The same is true when balanced working is applied to audio circuitry: not only does this mirror-imaging of the layout, in which identical components are handling the positive and negative ‘legs’ of the signal, cancel out any potential interference, it also means any noise or errors introduced in the circuitry will also be cancelled out.

	An additional benefit is that balanced working also uses stronger signals than unbalanced designs, simple because both halves of the circuit are active – rather than just having one half pushing and the other just providing the ground, here we have a ‘push pull’ operation. And a stronger signal means one less susceptible to any outside interference: the more signal there is, the less obvious any noise will be.

	
		
			
				
					
				
					The PM-10 uses a fully balanced layout, from the input section all the way through to the final power amplifier section: it has two sets of balanced inputs, and also conventional unbalanced line-level inputs (plus a high-quality phono stage), the signal from these inputs being converted to balanced working before being passed through the amplifier.
			
		
	


	By keeping the signal balanced all the way through the amplifier, and combining that with optimised power supply design, the Marantz engineers are able to achieve maximum noise rejection throughout the audio path, and the highest possible signal purity.



	Balanced, bridged power amplification


	For the PM-10, Marantz wanted the purest possible sound, plus the power and dynamics to drive and control some of the world’s most demanding speakers. To achieve this, they continued the balanced working found in the preamp stage right the way through to the power amplifier stage to its speaker outputs, and also adopted bridged working to develop the power required while maintaining that balanced design. This True Balanced Concept realizes a ground-free signal management from the input to the output.

	What is the bridged amplifier about? In a conventional amplifier, one speaker is driven by the positive and negative part of one single output stage per channel, but a bridged amplifier does things differently, using two separate amplifier stages per channel to drive one speaker. To greatly simplify things: one amp pushes the speaker cones and domes, while the other pulls them back.

	That much greater control over the way the speaker drive units behave, in that the amplifier can make them start moving, and stop, much more precisely is very important for definition and the ‘speed’ of the system, meaning it can play music with much better rhythmic and spatial controls, not to mention making voices and instruments sound more realistic.

	
		
			
				
					
				
					In the PM-10, the bridged amplifiers in the power output stage – a total of four amplifier channels – allow this control to be combined with huge power output: it delivers 2x200W into an 8ohm load, and can easily cope with demanding speakers or those whose impedance varies widely with frequency, thanks to a 2x400W output into 4ohms.
			
		
	


	That ensures not just the power to drive even big, power-hungry speakers to high levels while keeping the sound clean and distortion-free, but also the ‘grip’ to make sure those speakers are doing just what the music demands. It’s all made possible by the use of the latest switching amplifier technology, allowing a compact integrated amplifier design while still fulfilling Marantz performance requirements.



	Carefully selected components


	Marantz has long built a reputation for choosing the best-possible components for its Premium Series products – and if it can’t find what it wants, it designs and builds the required part.

	That thinking informed the design of the Hyper Dynamic Amplifier Module (or HDAM): unhappy with the audio quality available from ‘amplifier on a chip’ IC components, the company designed its own alternative, in the form of a miniature amplifier module built entirely of discrete components. As with all such design decisions, the engineers selected and optimised the HDAM through extensive listening in dedicated Marantz facilities in Europe and Japan, and since it was introduced this component has both been developed and also found its way into an ever-wider range of products.

	

	In the PM-10, the latest-generation HDAM SA3 is used, as part of a current feedback topology designed for the widest possible frequency and dynamic ranges – just the thing for today’s ultra-high-resolution audio formats – and aided by ultra-fast custom made block capacitors for the fastest possible response to demands for high current.

	The same current feedback design is applied to the phono stage in the PM-10, which is configurable for use with either moving coil or moving magnet cartridges for the best possible playback of those favourite LPs. This isn’t a case of Marantz responding to the current ‘vinyl revival’: over the years, while developing and refining its digital competences, the company has remained totally committed to the excellent sound possible from LPs and singles. It has long been fitting its products with high-quality phono stages – even before vinyl came back into fashion!



	Built to perform


	Like the partnering SA-10 Super Audio CD/CD player/DAC, the PM-10 is constructed to the highest possible standards, with a double-layered copper-plated chassis for excellent rejection of mechanical and electrical interference, and casework constructed from thick, heavy, non-magnetic aluminium panels. Both products also sit on aluminium die-cast feet.

	
		
			
				
					
				
					Even the speaker terminals here are special: even the highest-aiming rivals tend to use components bought in from third party companies, or designed as much for ‘show’ as ‘go’, but the PM-10 has newly-designed and exclusive Marantz SPKT-100+ terminals, made from high-purity solid copper.
			
		
	


	In common with every other design and engineering decision behind this new reference class amplifier, those terminals are there for one very simple reason:

						The PM6005 is more than an upgraded successor to the multi-awardwinning PM6004. Much more. Because now you can connect this superb integrated amplifier directly to a vast range of digital sources and use its superior DAC to create an unbelievably high level of audio enjoyment with new media.
						Of course, we have retained the pre-amp and power-amp sections that exclusively feature discrete components – not a single IC in sight of the signal path. That's because specially selected single components not only outperform ICs in quality, they also make it possible to refine the sound in much more detail, resulting in more clarity and transparency.
						And of course we have retained the lower impedance shielded Toroidal transformer, as well as the customized main capacitors. And of course all of the original features - such as five-line audio input including phono, two-pairs of gold-plated speaker connections with the convenience of bi-wiring, and a remote handset - are all still there. But now, the unit includes optical and coaxial digital inputs.
						The DAC is the 192kHz/24bit high current CS4398, which is already proven in many Premium Range products. And the complete digital section is fully shielded by an extra metal housing to ensure that the digital stage has no effect on the analogue signal. In short, the new PM6005 is your proven and excellent bridge to the future.

											Based on the ""Best CD player under £500"" by ""What Hi-Fi Sound and Vision?"" the new CD6005 is a fine-tuned version with even more specially selected components. We also added a solid metal bottom-plate and centralised the CD mechanism. That is how, for example, we virtually eliminated vibration.
											In addition, the oversized power supply feeds the digital and analogue circuitry of the player, where the high-quality CS4398 DAC converts digital signals to analogue, this is then 'pushed' to the gold-plated synch outputs by Marantz's own small signal amplifier, the HDAM-SA2. In addition, we have included a new remote that also controls the PM6005 amplifier.
											There is also a new 'Low-power Stand-by' and 'Auto Stand-by' mode to save electricity.
											Altogether, the CD6005 is a match made in heaven for the music lover who wants nothing but the best performance at an attractive price.
											One more thing: it is also perfect for lovers of portable music, thanks to its iPod-digital connectivity.

This latest iteration of amplifier and CD player sees both components share a tried-and-tested 192kHz/24-bit DAC, upstream from its custom HDAM audio stages, as used across the Marantz range. While the CD6006 now boasts specially selected components and a reworked circuit layout, the PM6006 gains an optical digital input and a beefier design better suited to driving a wider range of loudspeakers. If you’re seeking the high-end Marantz sound at a bargain price, this combination’s supremely polished, yet powerful performance won’t disappoint.""

	Passion for Music
	In both its shape and name, Principia collection embodies the idea of a beginning, a foundation, a primary element: plain and essential lines,

	like the ones that define the speaker’s design, and a name that stands for one’s starting point and entry in the audio high-end world. 

	Principia collection is a great solution for many different listening needs, meeting the requirements of stereo as well as multichannel

	Home Theater systems in both small and large rooms.
	The deep relationship with the Chameleon collection is evident in many design and technical details they share - particularly the brushed aluminum details and trapezoidal shape.

	The 29 mm high definition precoated fabric dome tweeter with DKM membrane is inherited from Chameleon as well, 

	while the other Silver polyproylene injected flat surface cone drivers are new Sonus faber designs and are unique to Principia.
	
	
	Playing the Music You Love
	A perfect sound is a right for all Music lovers.
	This is the Sonus faber’s unwavering belief that inspired the creation of Principia collection, 

	a family of entry level loudspeakers that makes high-end audio easier to achieve by those entering the high fidelity world as well as for those who are still looking for the right speaker that suits their musical tastes.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1954/1/principia.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1954/2/777.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1954/3/PM8006-2.jpg;

The result is even finer, more delicate audio detail. But even before these new refinements, this player was already standards-setter of repute because it utilises many of the advanced technologies that were originally developed for the Reference Series SA-7S1. For example, it uses the exclusive-to-Marantz Dynamic Digital Filtering technology, which makes standard CDs sound as incredible as SACDs. It offers two filters for different tastes, not just for discs, but for any digital signal. What’s more, it uses a high-end algorithm previously used only in professional recording studios. This type of filtering retains greater detail for an even wider sound stage and a perfect balance. In addition, it provides fully balanced signal handling on short, symmetrical, and discrete circuit architecture as well as the HDAM®SA2 high-speed amplifier module. The internal high-precision clock minimises jitter to the lowest possible level, while the rigid double-layer chassis dampens vibration to an absolute minimum. There is also extensive copper-plating and system-block shielding to keep the signal as clean as possible. You also get a high-quality headphone output featuring HDAM®SA2 and current feedback amplification. In addition, we have included a USB input on the front panel for playback and recharging. The DAC mode offers three digital inputs – the USB-B works in asynchronous mode when directly connected to the PC, plus coaxial and optical digital input. All of which means, you get more detail, more precision and more emotion than ever – and all in a wideopen sound stage that positions every instrument and vocalist with pin-point precision. This is enjoyment to the extreme.

						The new SA-14S1 includes an oversized Toroidal transformer and a strong power supply section that generates the cleanest of power to eliminate component cross-contamination. This is the perfect platform referencequality sound, and for the Marantz disc mechanism to provide superb CD and SACD sound quality. But that’s just the start of this amazing player. It includes a DAC-mode that’s almost identical in functionality to that of the revolutionary NA-11S1. It has optical and coaxial digital input as well as USB-B for direct connection to a PC. This means it provides direct high-definition audio streaming from your PC so you can make use of the high quality DAC and the high quality audio output stage with HDAM-SA2 modules. That’s why, importantly, this newly developed player also includes our latest ground/signal isolator technology, to virtually eliminate PC noise. The player can operate as a soundcard for your PC and the USB-B port works in asynchronous mode to support not only 192kHz / 24bits but also the DSD 2.8MHz and 5.6MHz for maximized versatility and performance. It even has a USB-A input on the front to play MP3, WAV, and AAC formats, and, of course it’s iPod/iPhone compatible. This is Super Audio CD quality in the sublime, and more. Much more.

	A History of Excellence


	A pioneer of CD playback and musical integrity, the first Marantz CD player — the CD-63 — premiered in 1982 and set the stage for further development and mastery of CD media players. Ken Ishiwata helped sculpt Marantz media players into the world-class, masterful technology that is synonymous with Marantz today. From his passion, the Limited Edition, Special Edition and later Ken Ishiwata Signature models were born — all designed to further optimize and elevate the exceptional CD performance of Marantz media players. That passion furthers the Marantz legacy of musical excellence with the SA-KI Ruby.

	
	 

	Transport Mechanism


	At the heart of the SA-KI Ruby is an innovative new SACDM-3 transport mechanism, engineered solely for the best possible performance when playing SA-CDs, CDs and music stored on data discs. This new mechanism promises exceptional sound quality from conventional CD and SA-CD discs and allows listeners to create their own high-resolution audio compilation discs using a computer DVD burner. The SA-KI Ruby supports FLAC files from 44.1kHz to 192kHz at up to 24-bit resolution, DSD2.8MHz and DSD 5.6MHz, ALAC (Apple Lossless), AIFF and MP3 files. Creating and playing hi-res disc compilations is as simple as it is enjoyable.

	
	 

	 

	
		
			
				
					CDs, SA-CDs and Beyond
				
				
					The SA-KI Ruby is a fully functional digital-to-analog converter for music stored on a home computer and features Optical and Coaxial digital inputs for existing source components. These inputs support files up to 192kHz/24bit and contain a USB-B asynchronous input for direct connection with a computer. The USB-B input is compatible with PCM and DXD music files at up to 384kHz/32bit, as well as DSD2.8MHz, DSD5.6MHz and DSD11.2MHz.
				
					 
					
			
			
				
					More Than a DAC
				
				
					Built with an integrated DAC, the SA-KI Ruby features an all-new disc transport mechanism that re-engineers the digital to analog conversion. Taking full advantage of the 1-bit conversion technology, the SA-KI RUBY incorporates innovative new filtering and up-conversion, providing a simple yet elegant solution.
				
					
					
			
		
	


	Marantz Musical Mastering: MMM-Stream and MMM-Conversion


	At the heart of digital audio in the SA-KI Ruby lies DSD. PCM and DXD inputs are up-converted to DSD at 11.2MHz using the proprietary MMM-Stream converter within the player, and the high-frequency signal produced is processed by the unique MMM-Conversion stage, used in place of a conventional DAC, to produce the analog output. The MMM-Stream section of the process replaces the oversampling filters normally used in digital to analog conversion and allows the implementation of the Marantz Musical Mastering filtering. Two system clocks ensure the most accurate up-conversion of the incoming signal, whether it’s from the disc or digital inputs, ranging from 44.1kHz to 12.288MHz. Sigma Delta Modulation allows a pure DSD-standard signal to be passed to the conversion section in the form of a very high-frequency stream of pulses. The design of the DSD-to-analog filter feeds into the familiar Marantz HDAM (Hyper Dynamic Amplifier Modules) in the output stage for optimal sound quality.

	
		
			
				
					High Current Power Supply
				
				
					The power supply of the SA-KI Ruby features a large high current toroidal power transformer with OFC (oxygen-free copper) secondary wires, along with high speed, high current Schottky Barrier Diodes in the rectifier stage for the purest DC voltage output.
				
					 
					
			
			
				
					System Remote Control
				
				
					The elegant remote control features an intuitive ergonomic layout and is equipped with amplifier control functions to operate both the SA-KI Ruby and the complementary PM-KI Ruby reference class integrated stereo amplifier. Use the integrated remote control input and output jacks to connect the SA-KI Ruby to other compatible Marantz components. An internal/external switch on the rear panel provides additional system control flexibility.
				
					
					
			
		
	


	 

	
		
			
				
					Pure Analog Design
				
				
					The purely analog design of the PM-KI Ruby contributes to its noise-reduction structure and clean build. Rather than build the DAC into the amplifier, which would add noise within the chassis, Marantz built the PM-KI Ruby without one and then implemented the DAC in the SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD Player. This eliminated interference with the delicate analog signals passing through the amp, maintaining an analog environment that’s as pure and clean as possible.
			
		
	


	
		
			
				
					Low Noise Fluorescent Display
				
				
					The deluxe low noise LC display features clear, easy to read alpha-numeric characters and is compatible with CD Text encoded music discs. Display can be turned off via the display control button on the remote. For enhanced user experience, bit depth of the input signal is now available on the front display of the SA-KI Ruby.
				
					 
					
			
			
				
					Dedicated Headphone Output
				
				
					Connect your favorite headphones directly to the SA-KI Ruby via the convenient front panel headphone jack, which also features its own selectable gain control. The headphone circuit is compatible with the widest range of headphone types and lower impedance headphones. The diameter of the volume knob was increased by 35% over the previous SA-14S1 for easier control and fine tune adjustments.
				
					
					
			
		
	


	Built to Perform


	Like the complementary PM-KI Ruby integrated amplifier, the SA-KI Ruby Super Audio CD player is constructed to the highest standards, with a copper-plated double layer chassis for rejection of mechanical interference, a front panel built from thick, heavy, non-magnetic aluminum panels and a 5mm thick aluminum top cover. Single layer, nickel-plated matching copper RCA terminals in the SA-KI Ruby outperform the terminals of competitors and offer an exemplary listening experience.

	

	More Than 60 Years of Audiophile Heritage


	Founded in 1953, Marantz has a long and rich history of designing audio components embraced by music lovers and critical listeners around the world. Because Music Matters, the SA-KI Ruby carries the tradition of delivering a best-in-class listening experience for music and cinema.

					The new Marantz SA-10 is the latest model in a range of high-end players stretching all the way back to the dawn of CD: in the original CD-63, launched in 1983, it had the first high-end performance-tuned CD player, and that expertise has continued to be developed over more than 30 years. The SA-10 is designed to sets new standards, whether with music on disc or content streamed from a computer, and to become the New Reference in digital audio.
				
					To achieve that, the SA-10 is a completely new design, drawing on all that experience in making great-sounding players but with virtually every part redesigned. That involved both innovation and some unique thinking, all in the cause of getting the best possible performance across a wide range of digital audio formats. The new model is an exceptional player of both CD and SACD discs, but can also play high-resolution music stored on computer-burned discs, as well as being a high-end digital to analogue converter for computer-stored music.
				
					From the unique new disc transport designed for this player all the way through to a complete rethink of the way digital audio data is converted into analogue signals, the SA-10 is a ‘clean sheet’ design, the result of painstaking research and development and extensive listening in Marantz’s custom-built listening facilities. That’s symptomatic of the way Marantz has always done things: while it always aims for the most elegant engineering solution, the listening test is always the final arbiter. It’s all to do with that simple phrase running through the heart of everything the company does: ‘Because Music Matters’.
				
				
				
					
						It starts with the disc
					
				
				
					
						
							
								
							
								Whether playing SA-CD or CD, or data discs containing music, it’s vital that any player retrieves the information as accurately as possible: unlike a computer reading a disc for ripping, there’s no time for repeated re-scans when playing music – it happens in real time, so the disc transport needs to get things right first time.
						
					
				
				
					Many modern CD and SACD players use computer-style DVD or ‘universal’ disc drives, simply because it’s increasingly difficult for manufacturers to source dedicated ‘music drives’, purely designed for SACD/CD playback.
					The Marantz solution? If you can’t buy it off the shelf, design it and have it made: at the heart of the SA-10 is an all-new SACD-M3 transport mechanism, engineered solely for the best possible performance when playing SA-CDs, CDs and music stored on data discs.
				
					Not only does this new mechanism promise the very best sound quality from conventional CD and SA-CD discs, its extended ability with the playback of music files stored on DVD-ROM discs makes it possible for users to create their own high-resolution audio compilation discs using a computer DVD burner. The SA-10 can play FLAC files from 32kHz to 192kHz at up to 24-bit resolution, and DSD64 and DSD128, well as ALAC (Apple Lossless), AIFF and MP3 files. That means making and playing hi-res disc compilations is now just as simple as it’s always been to make such discs in CD quality.
				
				
				
					
						CDs, SA-CDs and beyond
					
				
				
				
					However, the SA-10 goes so much further than just disc playback: it’s also a fully-functional digital-to-analogue converter for music stored on a home computer, as well as having conventional digital inputs for existing source components.
					Those conventional inputs – optical and coaxial – can handle files at up to 192kHz/24bit, but in addition the player’s digital input section includes a USB-B asynchronous input for the direct connection of a computer, and this is compatible with PCM and DXD music files at up to 384kHz/32bit, as well as DSD64, DSD128 and DSD256.
				
					That means the SA-10 is not only equipped to handle all the commonly-available high-resolution audio formats now sold by online retailers, but also the ultra-high-resolution files becoming available from a number of specialist labels and outlets. In other words, the new player is entirely futureproof.
					What’s more, the digital input section is completely isolated, to avoid any electrical noise from connected components – a particular problem when computers are used as a source – from finding its way into the signal-path.
				
				
				
					More than just a DAC
				
				
					CD players (and indeed amplifiers) with built-in DACs usable for computer audio are nothing new, and neither is DSD capability on such devices. Indeed, the Marantz range already has several CD/SA-CD models so equipped.
					However, the SA-10 takes things further – just as it features an all-new disc transport mechanism, so the digital to analogue conversion has also been subject to a radical rethink, taking full advantage of the 1-bit conversion technology found in past flagship Marantz players, and incorporating brand-new filtering and upconversion to take advantage of this simple, but elegant solution.
				
				
				
					
						Marantz Musical Mastering:
						MMM-Stream and MMM-Conversion
					
				
				
					
						
							
								
							
								DSD is at the heart of the way the SA-10 handles digital audio: PCM and DXD inputs are all upconverted to DSD at 11.2MHz using the proprietary MMM-Stream converter within the player, and then the high-frequency signal produced is processed by the unique MMM-Conversion stage, used in place of a conventional DAC, to produce the analogue output.
						
					
				
				
					The MMM-Stream section of the process replaces the oversampling filters normally used in digital to analogue conversion, and allows the implementation of the Marantz Musical Mastering filtering. These filters – one providing a slow roll-off and very short impulse response, the other offering the option of a medium roll-off with short pre-ringing and longer post-ringing – are essentially the same as those found in the Marantz SA-11 disc player and NA-11 network music player, but here they’re implemented at a much higher oversampling rate, thanks to that upconversion to DSD11.2.
				
					In fact, two system clocks are used, to ensure the most accurate upconversion of the incoming signal, whether its from disc or the digital inputs: the 44.1kHz of CD, and its multiples – 88.2kHz, 176.4kHz and so on – are upsampled to 11.2896MHz, while 48kHz and its multiples are taken up to 12.288MHz. This is done for maximum precision, and to avoid any need for sample rate conversion of the kind were the system to have to convert, say, 192kHz audio to DSD11.2.
				
					In addition, all of this conversion is now done in Digital Signal Processing with 32-bit floating-point precision, rather than the 24-bit integer method used in such systems in the past.
				
					
				
					Combining this with the reduction to a 1-bit signal straight after the oversampling filter and Sigma Delta Modulation allows a pure DSD-standard signal to be passed to the conversion section in the form of a very high-frequency stream of pulses, requiring only a very high-quality low-pass filter to remove all the superfluous high frequencies and pass the purest possible audio to the player’s output stage.
				
					So why develop all this in-house? The Marantz engineering team says that, as ever, extensive listening sessions gave the reasons: ‘We found big sound quality differences when PCM signals got converted to DSD outside of a conventional DAC and then fed to the DSD input of the conventional DAC. The conclusion of our finding was that for best sound quality we have to do the conversion ourselves.
				
					“This experience led us to evaluate all kind of SDM structures and optimise this to achieve the best sound quality.”
				
					The same thinking informed the design of the DSD-to-analogue filter itself, which feeds into the familiar Marantz HDAM (Hyper Dynamic Amplifier Modules) in the output stage, here used in dual-differential configuration for optimal sound quality.
				
					
				
					In the same way, even the headphone output on the player is optimised: like the HDAMs, it’s built entirely from discrete components, rather than using simpler ‘amp on a chip’ technology, for the very best sound quality.
				
				
				
					Built to perform
				
				
					Like the partnering PM-10 integrated amplifier, the SA-10 is constructed to the highest possible standards, with a double-layered copper-plated chassis for excellent rejection of mechanical and electrical interference, and casework constructed from thick non-magnetic aluminium panels and 5mm thick top lid. Both products also sit on aluminium die-cast feet.
				
					
				
					That may all seem very complex, as well as making it clear just how much work has gone into the design of this player, but in essence at the heart of the SA-10 is a digital-to-analogue solution that’s as elegant as it is innovative, and developed by the Marantz engineering team for one very simple reason:

		Analog Input Stage
	
		The foundation of the Nº 5805 is its proprietary PurePath signal path- a fully discrete, direct-coupled, dual-monaural line-level preamp circuit, for which the Shelton design team has two patents pending. A unique single gain stage mated to a digitally controlled resistor network for volume adjustment maintains maximum signal integrity and widest possible bandwidth. Each of its three stereo line level inputs—one balanced XLR and two single-ended, using custom Mark Levinson RCA connectors—has its own individual high-reliability signal switching relays.
	
		 
	
		Amplification
	
		The fully discrete, direct-coupled, class AB amplifier channels get their power from an oversized (500+ VA) toroidal transformer with individual secondary windings for the left and right channels. The voltage gain stage employs a topology directly descended from the acclaimed Nº 534 amplifier, which is mated to an output stage comprising two high-speed driver transistors operating in class A and six 260V, 15A output transistors.

Following the digital audio precendent set in our current solid state intergated amplfiers, the C53 stereo preamplifier features and upgradeable digital audio module. But unlike our integrated amplifiers that use our DA1 Digital Audio Module, the C53 is the first to use our new, more advance DA2 Digital Audio Module.
	
	The DA2 builds upon the DA1 with an expanded set of capabilities. In addition to having all the same connections as the DA1 (2 coaxial, 2 optical, 1 USB and 1 proprietary MCT for use with our MCT series of SACD/CD Transports), a new audio-only HDMI Audio Return Channel (ARC)1 connection is included on the DA2. This allows it to be connected to TVs with a compatible HDMI (ARC) output to bring your TV sound to a new level of audio performance by listening to it through your home stereo system.

When CEC communication is enabled in both the C53 and your TV, your TV remote can control the power and volume of the C53.
	 

	
	
		
	
	
		
			Additionally, the DA2’s USB input can support native playback of up to DSD512, surpassing the DSD256 limit of the DA1. This increased DSD playback support is thanks to the next generation, Quad Balanced, 8-channel, 32-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) that powers the DA2. This audiophile-grade DAC is highlighted by both an improved dynamic range and total harmonic distortion compared to the DA1. The USB input also supports DXD up to 384kHz. The coax and optical inputs can decode digital music up to 24-bit/192kHz for high resolution audio playback. Rounding out the DA2 is an MCT input that offers a secure, custom DSD connection for playback of the high definition audio found on SACDs when paired with our MCT series of SACD/CD Transports to produce the best possible sound quality from your SACD collection.
	


	
		
			In addition to the 7 digital inputs found in the DA2 module, the C53 also has 9 analog inputs, giving it a nearly inexhaustible number of 16 total inputs for connecting all your music sources. The analog inputs consist of 3 balanced and 4 unbalanced connections, plus 1 Moving Coil and 1 Moving Magnet phono inputs for plugging in your trusted turntable. Outputs include 3 variable balanced and unbalanced connections along with 1 fixed unbalanced connection.
	


	
	
		
	
	
		
			Tone controls include an 8-band analog equalizer; each band can be adjusted ± 12dB so you can fine tune your music just the way you like. Our High Drive Headphone Amplifier can power virtually any pair of headphones, while Headphone Crossfeed Director (HXD®) can bring an added dimension to your music. Home Theater Pass Through lets the C53 be seamlessly integrated into your home theater system. Power Control ports let you easily turn other connected McIntosh components on and off, while the Data Ports can send remote control commands to connected source components.

				""Carved like a boat designed to surf all the waves of music."" Listening to it proved it to be ""fast, powerful, precise... but without losing the sublime McIntosh charm."" Presented with ON Magazine Top Audio Award. - ON Magazine
			
				A ""beautifully designed amplifier"" with a ""relaxing approach to the music, but still it plays with control and power."" It is ""pure pleasure for the ears."" Awarded 5 Stars. - Stereo+
		
		
			The MA252 features our McIntosh Monogrammed Heatsinks™ which are connected to advanced high current output transistors. These transistors eliminate the typical amplifier warm-up time so that the MA252 is in peak operating condition from the moment it’s turned on. A powerful control microprocessor is used for smooth system operation, along with some of the latest audio-grade circuit components that deliver the best possible sound.
		
			
				The McIntosh MA252 amplifier ""is not only appealing to look at, it sounds great too. Far bigger than its size should indicate, and there is no reason to doubt the power, because it kicks hard."" Awarded 5 Stars. - Lyd & Bilde
			
				""The McIntosh MA252 is not only a time machine that allows you to travel 30 or 50 years ago [when listening to classic albums], but it also takes you to the future: you spend from morning to afternoon or from evening to night with it in what seems like an instant. It sonically fills 25 square meters [270 square feet], does its job and disappears from the room."" Presented with HIFI Live Magazine High Quality Award. - HIFI Live Magazine
		
		
			Thanks to its solid state output, the MA252 is our first product containing vacuum tubes to include our patented Power Guard® technology. Power Guard monitors the output signal for signs of over driving and makes real time micro adjustments to the input signal to prevent harsh sounding clipping that could potentially damage your speakers. If Power Guard is activated, the 2 vacuum tubes connected to the affected audio channel(s) will flash an amber color; they will return to their normal green color when the clipping has stopped.
		
			
				""The MA252 is a component worthy of consideration as the core to an audio system that will allow the user to listen for hours without fatigue. And, based on McIntosh's reputation for long-term reliability and service, possibly listen for decades."" - Stereo Times
			
				""The McIntosh MA252 is an amplifier that will prove hard to replace. It will allow you to find speakers that are the best suited to your tastes, and it will pamper them appropriately. A first-class amplifier."" - Son-Vidéo
		
		
			
				""Once again, McIntosh presented us a high quality product, embracing the wonderful philosophy of the brand. The expectations were big on our end and from what I heard during these listening sessions, I can, without a doubt, affirm that McIntosh succeeded the test on all points."" - TED Magazine
		
		
			Other McIntosh technologies found in the MA252 include Sentry Monitor™, High Drive headphone amplifier and gold-plated speaker binding posts. Input selection, bass, treble, tone bypass, balance and input offset levels can be adjusted using the front panel knobs or the included remote control; all settings and input selection will be shown on the OLED display. The entire unit sits atop a beautiful polished stainless steel chassis with a classic McIntosh-styled die cast aluminum name badge attached to each side.

This includes select McIntosh home theater processors, integrated amplifiers and preamplifiers.

For SACD playback, the MCT500’s proprietary MCT output needs to be connected (via the included cable) to a McIntosh product with an MCT input. This includes the D1100, C53, C2700, C49 and D150 preamplifiers, MA9000, MA8900, MA7200 or MA5300 integrated amplifiers or MAC7200 receiver. When the MCT500 is connected to one of these devices, a secure digital connection is created, allowing for the playback of the high definition audio found on SACDs. Regular CDs can also be played over the MCT connection.

All common disc types can be played on the MCT500, including SACD, CD, CD-R/RW and DVD-R. A twin laser optical pickup assures optimal disc reading. A USB input is conveniently located on the front panel for easy access. In addition to store bought CDs and SACDs, popular file formats such as AAC, AIFF, ALAC, DSD (up to DSD128), FLAC, MP3, WAV (up to 24-bit/192kHz) and WMA can be played from user generated CD or DVD Data Discs and USB flash drives.1";;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2017/1/MCT500.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2017/2/MCT500FrontTopbackground.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2017/3/MCT500FrontTop.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2017/4/MCT500Angle.jpg

			At first glance, the McIntosh MTI100 Integrated Turntable may look like it’s just a turntable, but a closer look will reveal that it is in fact so much more. Truly a one-of-a-kind product, it is designed for those who want maximum flexibility in their home audio system but don’t want – or don’t have the space for – a large audio system in their home. With all the built-in connectivity the MTI100 offers, it can become the center piece of a modern home audio system for modern lifestyles. Simply add your favorite speakers of choice (such as our XR50 bookshelf or XR100 floorstanding speakers) and you’ll have a complete and comprehensive audio system.
		
			Besides the turntable that plays both 33-1/3 and 45 rpm vinyl records, the MTI100 also includes a power amplifier, a vacuum tube preamplifier section, a shielded phono preamplifier, an unbalanced auxiliary input, digital audio coaxial and optical inputs, a Bluetooth receiver, a subwoofer output, stereo speaker outputs for sharing your music with friends, and a headphone jack for personal listening.
		
			
				""There is no audible noise in any section of the MTI100. Phono and digital sections are free of playback artifacts, even with highly sensitive speakers... a piece of sonic artistry, that provides high-end sound from all the sources you can imagine, and looks great doing it... The level of quality, functionality, and audio performance makes it the perfect purchase for anyone wanting a high quality, all-inclusive music system."" Named The Audiophile Apartment’s Product of the Year 2019. - The Audiophile Apartment
		
	


	
	
		
	
	
		
			The 7 pound (3.18 kg) machined aluminum platter resides on the top of the unit. This and the matching machined aluminum tonearm with anti-skate sit atop a 3/8” (9.5mm) thick piece of glass – the same glass found in the front panels of our larger amplifiers; this in turn sits atop a custom 1/4” (6.35mm) thick metal plate that adds stability. The combined heftiness of both the platter and metal plate helps resist and absorb noise that could be caused by external vibrations.
		
			
				The MTI100 ""oozes class and luxury..."" no other product Brockhouse has reviewed ""elicited more oohs and ahs than the MTI100..."" its ""big, spacious sound"" made ""listening to music an event."" - SoundStage
		
	


	
	
		
	
	
		The belt drive platter with manual speed change is driven by an industrial grade permanent magnet AC synchronous motor with a 2 speed pulley. With this motor, the platter speed is precisely synced to the AC power line’s frequency to deliver precise rotational speeds for playback accuracy. The MTI100 comes with a Sumiko Olympia Moving Magnet cartridge, whose upgraded stylus and cantilever assembly allow for more dynamic punch and improved frequency response.


	
		
			
				""For an all-in-one device, the MTI100 rocks!"" With all its connectivity options, ""it can comfortably function as the heart of a more extensive system... sure to appeal to today’s millennials who have a vinyl collection and high expectations for sound quality, as well as to audiophiles who may be down/right-sizing or looking for a simple second system with minimal compromise."" - SoundStage Australia
		
		
			A Class D amplifier that’s rated for 80 Watts per channel into 4 Ohms or 50 Watts per channel into 8 Ohms is used to drive a pair of speakers (sold separately) that are connected via the back panel speaker binding posts. Two 12AX7 vacuum tubes power the main preamplifier section, while a separate dedicated phono preamplifier is housed in a custom shielding box that prevents interference or noise from seeping into the vinyl signal. Together, the vacuum tube preamplifier and shielded phono preamplifier are a perfect choice to help make your vinyl albums sound their best.
	


	
	
		
	
	
		To combine playing vintage vinyl records with modern playback methods, you can also stream music to the MTI100 via its High Definition Bluetooth 4.2 input that ensures you receive the best sound quality possible from your Bluetooth device. An external Bluetooth antenna helps achieve optimal reception and signal quality. The analog and digital audio inputs allow external sources, such as a TV, tuner or CD Player, to be connected. Not to overlook the impact that low sound frequencies can add, a subwoofer output is also included. Finally, for personal listening, the front panel includes a headphone jack that is powered by our High Drive headphone amplifier, which features increased gain and output power and is optimized for virtually all headphone types.
	
		 


	
		Power, volume and input selection can be controlled by either the included remote or via two knobs on the unit. An illuminated McIntosh logo is located in the top glass panel, while a classic McIntosh-styled die cast aluminum name badge adorns the front of the chassis. Contact your local dealer to learn more about making the MTI100 the center of your home audio system.

Designed for a modern streaming lifestyle, it comes packed with virtually everything you need to enjoy music streamed from your handheld devices, digital music stored online or a local computer, or played from legacy audio sources. Even connect it to your TV for better sound.
			
				The RS200 offers 650 Watts of total power that is delivered to 8 drivers consisting of (2) 4” x 6” woofers, (4) 2” midranges and (2) ¾” tweeters. In addition, a subwoofer output is included to connect an external powered subwoofer to further enhance low frequencies. As the RS200 can be placed in a variety of locations with unique sonic characteristics, a 3-position EQ switch allows you to set the EQ based on your room and listening preferences.
			
				The RS200 comes loaded with several streaming options. It features Apple® AirPlay® 2; Bluetooth® 5.0 with support for AAC, Qualcomm® aptX™ HD for hi res playback and Qualcomm aptX Low Latency for improved audio transmission speed to deliver sound in sync with visual media; DTS Play-Fi® whole-home wireless audio; and DLNA support.
		
	


	
		
		
			
		
		
			For non-streaming applications, it has an audio-only HDMI ARC1 input that connects only to TVs that have Audio Return Channel (ARC) capabilities; an optical input to connect TVs without ARC, or digital sources such as CD Players; a USB Type-B input to play music from your Macintosh or Windows computer; and a 3.5mm AUX input for connecting various analog music sources.
	
	
		
			
				
					""Sound quality! It is a McIntosh through and through"" offering ""plenty of power to raise the roof, and delivers music with a wonderful smoothness."" ""Run the TV through it... feed some of your favorite playlists through it, sit back, and enjoy!"" Those that have limited space for a quality home audio system ""would be foolish not to look at the McIntosh RS200. Hell, don't just look at it. Stare at it for a while and listen to it with deep intent. I think you will find yourself as enamored with it as I was."" - Positive Feedback
			
		
	
	
		
		
			
		
		
			Not just for music, you can connect the RS200 to your TV to enjoy better sound than your TV speakers or soundbars can provide. With the amazing 4K video today’s TVs can produce, it’s time the sound matched the picture quality. For enveloping home theater sound, connect a pair of our Play-Fi compatible RS100 Wireless Speakers (sold separately) to use as surround speakers.
	
	
		
			AirPlay 2 is an Apple technology designed to control home audio systems and speakers in any room – with a tap or by just asking Siri – right from an iPhone®, iPad®, HomePod™, or Apple TV®. It offers multiroom audio, Siri voice control, and enhanced playback. The RS200 is an Amazon Works With Alexa certified product. Simply speak to your Alexa control device to operate your RS200 from any room.2 You can designate the RS200 as your Alexa Preferred Speaker in the Alexa app, then you’ll no longer need to specify the RS200 by name in order for music to play on it. Voice commands as simple as “Alexa, play top-40” to a linked control device will initiate playback on the RS200. The RS200 does not contain any listening capabilities and relies entirely on an Alexa control device for voice control. (How do I setup Alexa?)
	
	
		
		
			
		
		
			Play-Fi from DTS has built-in interfaces for many leading streaming services including Amazon Prime Music, Pandora®, Qobuz, SiriusXM®, Spotify® and TIDAL to name just a few (list subject to change).3 You can save up to four of your favorite Play-Fi streaming services via the preset buttons on the top of the RS200; once configured, you can quickly play the saved streaming services directly from the cloud without needing a mobile device by simply tapping the preset buttons. You can also stream audio from wired devices connected to the RS200 to other Play-Fi devices on your network (such as the RS100 Wireless Speaker) via Play-Fi Line In Broadcasting. And Play-Fi’s Critical Listening mode allows you to send your high resolution audio files to the RS200 with no transcoding or downsampling.
	
	
		
			With its space saving design and room filling sound, the RS200 is versatile enough to accommodate the audio needs of any room in your home. While designed for modern streaming, it features classic McIntosh design elements such as a black glass front panel, illuminated logo, control knobs, and a pair of fast responding blue Watt meters. A free app is available for Apple devices to check and update the RS200's firmware (an Android version will be available soon). Contact your local dealer to learn more.

	The Z20 Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC) provides the perfect solution to high quality reproduction of digital audio, from whatever source. It can be the interface between a PC, Mac or laptop and your hi-fi system, and it can provide a sonic upgrade to the stereo sound from your CD, DVD or Blu-Ray player.

	 

	The Z20’s design features:

	
		
			Coaxial (S/PDIF), Optical (Toslink) and USB (2.0) inputs
		
			All inputs 192kHz/24bit capable
		
			Asynchronous USB receiver isolates the Z20’s DAC from computer clock jitter, resulting in clean precise sound
		
			All sources, at any bit-rate, are asynchronously up-sampled to 192kHz/24bit for accurate reproduction
		
			High end Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC chip – as used in Myryad MX CD players
		
			Myryad “Smart My-Link®” for intelligent system operation with other Myryad products
	


	 

	The Z20 is the first Myryad product in the new Zmini Series – featuring similar styling to the new Z200s, but in a half-width case.

	 

	
		The environment within a PC or other computer is inherently noisy and digital audio output streams are subject to jitter. The Z20 DAC employs double isolation to ensure a clean audio signal from its USB input. First an asynchronous USB receiver is employed which re-times the audio data according to one of the two low-jitter master clocks (one for 44.1/88.2/176.4 kHz and one for 48/96/192 kHz). After that comes an Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter which up-samples all incoming audio streams (USB, coaxial and optical) to 192kHz/24bit. This further reduces clock jitter and produces a constant high speed data stream for the DAC chip itself.
	
		 
	
		The Z20 uses the same Cirrus Logic CS4398 DAC chip as Myryad’s high-end MXC7000 CD player. The CS4398 is a fifth order delta-sigma converter which delivers wide dynamic range, low noise and low distortion. It actually contains four separate DACs – with push-pull outputs for each of the stereo channels. Each output feeds a differential-input low-pass analogue filter using a high-speed low-distortion FET input op-amp, close-tolerance metal film resistors and precision polypropylene film/foil capacitors. This arrangement suppresses ground-related noise from the DAC and delivers the cleanest possible audio output. To ensure no degradation of this pristine audio signal there is no coupling capacitor in the signal path to the output jacks. Instead a second high-speed low-distortion FET input op-amp is used to provide a “DC servo” to eliminate DC on the line outputs.
	
		 
	
		The power supply employs a low-noise toroidal mains transformer with separate windings for analogue and digital circuitry. It is mounted inside a steel screening enclosure to reduce any magnetic interaction even further. The transformer is of a special low-idle-power design so the Z20 draws less than 0.5W of power in standby – without the need for a separate standby transformer.
	
		 
	
		A total of 10 separate power supply regulators are used in the Z20, each optimised for its own task. They ensure that high-speed digital processing devices are isolated from each other and that no noise from these circuits can affect the analogue audio side. There is a separate high-isolation power supply solely for the master crystal clocks to maintain the lowest possible jitter.

2140;NAD C658 / C 658 BluOS Streaming DAC; IDR19.990.000,00 ; IDR-   ;hot;0;The NAD C658 is a neww kind of stereo component, one that at once changes preconceptions and oepns new possibilities for audio reproduction. You see, there has never before been a component offering such a rich palette of both new and proven technology. Bold statements;"INTRODUCING THE NAD C658
	Redefining the Architecture of Hi-Fi Playback
	As we move deeper into the 21st Century the way music distributed and enjoyed continues to evolve away from physical media to streaming. It also has moved away from analog to digital. The C658 has incorporated there fundamental truths to create an entirely new type of component that combines a Network Streamer, a state pf the art DAC, and many aspects of the traditional Preamplifier into a single highly cost effective package. And thanks to NAD's exclusive Modular Design Contruction, it will keep pace with the latest technology, not yet introduced, but inevitably coming in the future. In fact an optional HDMI 4K switcher module is available now allowing the best sound from any of the many HDMI sources available. While the C658 immeditely replace your streamer, DAC, and Preamp, it also adds many new features you may not be awawre of, like a Bluetooth aptX HD transmitter to use with your wireless headphone.
	
	BluOS Enabled
	Also on board is BluOS, the most sophisticated High Res streaming system available. BluOS natively supports over 15 streaming music services and indexing of over 250,000 tracks from local network sources. The C 658 becomes a node in the BluOS ecosystem allowing high res network streaming to 64 zones and control options for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS phones, tablets, and desk top devices. BluOS also supports all major smart home controllers and is available in a wide range of products making it easy to create a whole house audio system with the C 658 at its heart.
	
	Traditional NAD Performance and Value
	The C 658 is part of our Classic Series of components which have an enviable reputation for giving Music Lovers more enjoyment for less money. If you want a solid block of hand–crafted aluminum with gold plated accents you’ll need to look elsewhere. If you want state-of-the-art performance and features in a sturdy no-nonsense package then you have the right address.
	
	High Resolution in Every Detail
	Most NAD components have been High Res for 45 years with very wide bandwidth, low distortion, and ultra-low noise. We just never had High Res source material to play. With High Res digital recording and streaming, combined with advanced technology like MQA, record companies are opening their vaults and releasing Studio Master Quality recordings. MQA decoding is available through BluOS Streaming content. The C 658 is pure High Res from input to output and features the ESS Sabre 32bit DAC , one of the best performing DACs on the market today with its 118dB Dynamic Range and incredibly low jitter spec. All preamp functions are executed in the digital domain including the same wide range non-truncating digital volume control used in our Masters Series components. This offers an incredibly short analog signal path that, rather uniquely, is identical for all volume settings. Sophisticated active power supplies provide super clean voltages to all circuits to keep noise and distortion at the edge of measurability.
	
	Make the Speakers Disappear (It's Not Magic)
	The C658 is also the first NAD stereo component to a feature Dirac Live room correction, the most sophisticated and effective room correction available. Dirac corrects the impulse response of your speakers, in addition to the frequency response of your room, for a truly transparent window into the musical perormance. When the room resonances are tamed and the transient response is corrected, the result is magical. You have never heard your speakers sound this invisible or this good
	
	Master Quality Authenticated
	Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) is a revolutionary end to end technology built into every BlueOS Enabled amplifier to capture and deliver MQA music to your speakers in the purest quality. All BlueOS Enabled players and systems include a powerful decoder and audio rendere for the millions of the MQA encode songs, The MQA logo shown in the BlueOS app indicates that the unit is decoding ad playing an MQA stream or file, and lets you know that you are hearing exactly what the artist recorded and approved in the studio

1888;OPTOMA PROJECTOR UHZ 65  4K; IDR84.150.000,00 ; IDR75.735.000,00 ;hot;0;The UHZ65\'s image quality for film and video is every bit as impressive as you would expect from the price. Along with fine detail, it delivers rich, natural-looking color and both a high enough contrast ratio and the subtle shading needed to add a convincing sense of three dimensionality. Surprisingly, given the visibly high contrast, a solid black image has a noticeable glow in a dark room. However, the black areas don\'t get any brighter if you add bright elements to the image, which is the more important factor for contrast.;"The UHZ65's image quality for film and video is every bit as impressive as you would expect from the price. Along with fine detail, it delivers rich, natural-looking color and both a high enough contrast ratio and the subtle shading needed to add a convincing sense of three dimensionality. Surprisingly, given the visibly high contrast, a solid black image has a noticeable glow in a dark room. However, the black areas don't get any brighter if you add bright elements to the image, which is the more important factor for contrast.

	There is also no visible change in black level when you change brightness by adjusting the power level, which has settings from 50% to 100% in 5% increments. So the higher the power level, the better the contrast will be. If you use the UHZ65 with a small screen in a dark room, you may have to settle for somewhat lower contrast, since the higher power levels may be too bright. However, this won't be an issue for the screen sizes you need in order to see all the detail available at 3820x2160 resolution, particularly in a room with ambient light.

	 

	Color accuracy with default settings for the Cinema color preset is good enough to use straight out of the box. There's a slight blue bias compared with a calibrated projector, but it is easy to adjust to neutral color. And unlike most color presets for DLP projectors, Cinema mode is designed to offer accurate colors with Brilliant Color at 10--the highest setting--for maximum white brightness. Most of the same comments apply to Reference mode, except that its default setting for Brilliant Color is 1, which translates to being off. Reference mode also has lower contrast than Cinema mode.

	Bright mode has an obvious magenta shift with default settings, but color accuracy improves significantly if you drop Brilliant Color to 1 from the default of 10. Game mode maintains color accuracy fairly well and delivers good contrast, but it loses subtle gradations the eye uses as cues to three dimensionality. The loss in depth won't matter for games and animations, and the high contrast will be a plus.

	There's also an HDR Sim mode that's meant to add an HDR look to SDR content by enhancing gamma, contrast, and color saturation. The enhancement goes a little too far, however, leading to oversaturated color. The actual HDR mode is available for HDR input only, and does a far better job.

	You can customize any of the preset color modes or the one User mode to taste. In addition, the UHZ65 is ISF certified, so if you pay an ISF-certified technician to calibrate it, the menus will also include ISF Day and Night modes. The color modes in the menu also includes 3D, but there is no support for Blu-ray 3D. The UHZ65 supports only PC-based 3D.

	 

	Optoma's version of Frame Interpolation (FI) is called PureMotion. As with any version of FI it introduces a digital video effect that can be a distraction for watching film but can enhance the crispness of live or recorded video.

	 

	With default settings for Cinema mode, PureMotion is on and set to 1, the lowest of its three levels. Level 1 smoothes motion only a little while adding a slight, but obvious, digital video effect. Both increase at each step, with judder completely gone at the highest level, and filmed content looking like live video in most scenes. I didn't see any motion artifacts at the lowest level, and fewer artifacts at the highest than with most FI features. You can also turn FI off if you prefer.

	Video Optimized Lumens. The Cinema and Reference color presets both offer close to accurate color without any adjustments. Cinema delivering the brighter image of the two, and it doesn't lose any brightness if you adjust it to eliminate the slight blue bias. At 1633 lumens, it is bright enough for a 185"" diagonal 16:9 image in a dark room or a 115"" image with moderate ambient light.

	Presentation Optimized Lumens. The UHZ65 is obviously not designed primarily for presentations, but it can handle them well. Bright mode with default settings is the obvious choice for presentations that don't include photos. Some colors are significantly shifted, but the 2845 lumens can give you a 130"" or larger image that can stand up to ambient light.

	Low Lamp Modes. The 10 steps in power levels below 100% behave as advertised, lowering the measured brightness by 5% of the full brightness at each step down to 50%.

	Zoom Lens effect. The 1.6x zoom lens offers good flexibility for how far you can position the projector from the screen, but with enough loss of brightness to notice. At the full telephoto setting, the lens curtails light by about 23% compared with the wide-angle setting. That's not unusual for a 1.6x zoom lens. But it is enough that for maximum brightness, you'll want the UHZ65 as close to the screen as possible.

	Brightness uniformity. The 56% measured brightness uniformity is unusually low a home theater projector. The variation across the screen is easy to see with a solid white image, with the left and right sides obviously not as bright as the broad center swath. Fortunately, most film and video images break up the field of view enough to effectively hide the variation, and the eye will tend to interpret any visible difference as being part of the original image. It helps too that the brightness drops off only near the edges of the screen, where you're least likely to be looking while watching a movie.

	Input Lag. Using 1080p content, the input lag with all color modes is 80 ms with FI off and 147 ms with FI on at any setting.

	Low Rainbow Activity. With three different movies, I saw rainbow artifacts occasionally in one, less often in another, and exceedingly rarely in a third. Few people, if any, should find them bothersome.

	On-Board Stereo. Any projector that costs as much as the UHZ65 pretty much demands being paired with a high quality external sound system. That said, the UHZ65 includes two on-board 4-watt stereo speakers if you need them. Sound quality is on a par with a typical large-screen TV, and the volume is enough to fill a good-size family room.

	One minor issue with movies on 1080p Blu-ray discs is that if you jump ahead or back the audio and video fall out of sync with no easy way to match them up again. However, this happened only when I allowed the Blu-ray player to auto connect at 3840x2160 and upscale the image. When I set it to connect at 1080p, and let the UHZ65 upscale the image, the audio and video stayed in sync.

	Fan Noise. Optoma rates fan noise at 33dB at 100% power and 29dB at 50%, which makes it a little louder than most home theater projectors. At 100%, you can hear it from 10 feet away at quiet moments as a steady, low-pitched whoosh. But even from 5 feet it will fade into the background for anyone who isn't particularly bothered by noise. At 50% power, the fan noise is low enough that it is unlikely anyone will find it bothersome from 5 feet away.

	High Altitude mode, which Optoma recommends using at 5,000 feet and above, is loud enough at all power settings to notice in quiet moments from anywhere in a typical-size home theater. If you need to use High Altitude mode, and particularly if fan noise is one of your pet peeves, consider positioning the projector behind a false wall or behind the screen to help deaden the sound.

	Lamp life. The laser-phosphor engine is meant to last the life of the projector. Optoma rates it at 20,000 hours in full brightness mode, and says it should last even longer at lower power settings.

	Warranty. The price includes a three-year warranty for the projector, including the light engine, with express advanced exchange.

383;Polk Audio Blackstone TL1600; IDR5.499.000,00 ; IDR-   ;hot;0;High performance, compact size, surprising price;"All Blackstone TL Series Compact Speakers Feature:
	
	Time Lens Technology
	Time Lens technology aligns the acoustic centers of the tweeter and mid-bass driver on the same spatial plane for superior imaging, while an acoustic lens incorporated in the grille smoothes the tweeter's frequency response. This alignment and grille lens technology creates imaging realism and frequency balance unheard of in small, high performance satellite speakers.
	
	Curved Enclosure Design
	Employs non-parallel surfaces that not only lead to a stronger, more rigid and acoustically inert enclosure, but they also result in less audible coloration from internal surface resonances. We've literally designed-out the usual limitations of small-enclosures. It's a new category of compact loudspeaker: the kind that sounds amazing. (And looks great doing it.)
	
	Dynamic Balance® Driver Technology
	If you could tune out the bad sounds before they even happen, you'd do it, wouldn't you? Polk Audio's patented Dynamic Balance process allows us to design our drivers specifically for flatter frequency response, revealing the sharpest details and a more lifelike transparency, with absolutely no strain even at high volume. It's a bold, rich, warm and lifelike sound.
	
	Hi-Gloss ""Blackstone"" Finish
	A durable, deep automotive-strength finish that matches today's most stylish flat-panel TVs and the decor they live in: yours.
	
	Multiple Mounting Options
	Compact means go-anywhere for Blackstone TL: on shelves, on the wall, on stands. Built-in Keyhole Slots and threaded inserts (that fit virtually any brackets) give you multiple mounting options.

	RC60i's round profile looks just like a lighting fixture so it will blend into your ceiling without calling attention to itself. But they sound sooooo much better than your typical in-ceiling speakers that resemble a watering spout.
	
	RC60i Features:

	
		Easy one-cut, drop-in installation puts built-in audio within reach, with Perfect Fit templates, a precision flange, and (available) pre-construction brackets.
	
		RCi speakers utilize the ""virtual enclosure"" of your in-wall and in-ceiling space to enhance their bass response and smooth low frequency blending with the midrange.
	
		Lightweight and stiff blue polymer cones deliver excellent damping and bass response.
	
		Durable, computer-modeled, injection-molded butyl rubber surrounds suppress unwanted cone resonances for a lifetime of reliable sound.
	
		Aimable swivel tweeters for greater accuracy and more realistic imaging. (All models except RC6s.).
	
		Rustproof stainless steel hardware, durable butyl rubber surrounds and powder coated aluminum (in-ceiling) & painted steel (in-wall) grilles make RCi Series speakers suitable for high moisture areas like bathrooms or even under eaves of an enclosed porch. (RCi series are not suitable for exposed outdoor use).
	
		RCi speakers have paintable grilles and practically disappear into any room.
	
		RCi Series speakers are timbre-matched to other Polk speakers to insure utterly seamless blending from speaker to speaker in systems that combine traditional and built-in speakers.

						Dynamic Balance Technology Driver Design
					
						Whether upgrading your home theatre setup with an advanced Atmos configuration or enjoying your favourite music, Dynamic Balance ensures a rich, clean, full-range sound no matter what you’re listening to. This patented technology analyses the speaker’s entire electro-acoustic and mechanical system for improved material selection and more efficient geometry. It pinpoints and eliminates issues that reduce speaker performance before they become a part of the finished product.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						High-Resolution Polk Terylene Tweeter
					
						Our Terylene dome tweeter features curvilinear formers that extend response and lower resonance. Its powerful ceramic motor structure also lowers system resonance and extends low- frequency response for better dispersion in the critical midrange, delivering clear and detailed high-frequency response for realistic reproduction of vocals and instruments. Capable of delivering 40kHz to support the latest high-resolution audio files so it feels like you’re right there in the studio or concert hall.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Custom Mid-Range Drivers
					
						Mica-reinforced polypropylene cones with butyl rubber surrounds, massive ceramic motor structures and high-temperature Conex fiber spiders combine to create drivers of exceptionally high efficiency, for clean, clear bass, better linearity, lower distortion and greater durability.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Exclusive Polk Power Port Technology
					
						Power Port® is our patented design that smoothly transitions the air flow from the speaker’s port into your listening area. It also extends the overall bass port, providing greater surface area to eliminate turbulence and distortion, for bigger, more musical, deep bass impact. Plus, it offers 3dB more bass response output than a traditional port.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						High Sensitivity and Maximum Compatibility
					
						Works with the most modestly powered amplifier or receiver. Whether you’re connecting them to the newest digital processor or your vintage rig, you get sound reproduction that’s spacious, clear, enveloping, and realistic. Plus, it’s compatible with latest Dolby and DTS surround sound technologies.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Three-Driver Phase optimised Cascading Tapered Crossover Array
					
						Gives you a focused dialogue channel that blends seamlessly with other Polk Signature series speakers to deliver an enhanced sweet spot for a more realistic listening experience.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Anti-Diffraction Magnetic Grille
					
						Computer modeled for a precision fit and enhanced good looks—and made to minimize sonic interference.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Dual Gold Plated 5-Way Binding Posts
					
						Perfect for easy setup, they ensure the most direct, efficient, and loss-less connection possible.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Dual-Floor Compatible Feet
					
						Customized for improved stability and bass coupling to the floor, the speaker tower feet are designed for both carpet and hard floors.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Quality, critically damped Cabinet Design
					
						Strong, rigid and acoustically inert enclosure that reduces unwanted internal standing waves for less audible coloration. And non-resonant, critically damped Meddite MDF construction, ensures low self noise for a more lifelike sound.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Timbre-Matched
					
						Designed with the same components throughout to achieve seamless speaker-to-speaker blending effects in multi-channel systems.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Modern Styling
					
						Curved edges offer a sensual yet powerful look that fits with any home decor—available in a stunning black or white washed walnut finishes.
				
			
			 
			
				
					
						Limited Warranty, Built to Last
					
						Designed in California, engineered in Baltimore and manufactured under the strictest quality controls, Polk speakers are built to last and include a limited 5-year warranty.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1535/1/Untitled-1.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1535/2/s50-2.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1535/3/s50-3.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/1535/4/s50-1.jpg

																		In-Ceiling Audiophile Magic
																	
																		RC60i’s round profile looks just like a lighting fixture so it will blend into your ceiling without calling attention to itself. But they sound sooooo much better than your typical in-ceiling speakers that resemble a watering spout.
																	
																		RC60i Features:
																	
																		Easy one-cut, drop-in installation puts built-in audio within reach, with Perfect Fit templates, a precision flange, and (available) pre-construction brackets; achieve secure, vibration-free efficiency with a simple turn of the patented Rotating Cam system.
																	
																		With infinite baffle tuning, RCi speakers utilize the ""virtual enclosure"" of your in-wall and in-ceiling space to enhance their bass response and smooth low frequency blending with the midrange.
																	
																		Lightweight and stiff blue polymer cones deliver excellent damping and bass response.
																	
																		Durable, computer-modeled, injection-molded butyl rubber surrounds suppress unwanted cone resonances for a lifetime of reliable sound.
																	
																		Aimable swivel tweeters for greater accuracy and more realistic imaging. (All models except RC6s.)
																	
																		Polk’s proprietary, patented Dynamic Balance® technology allows our engineers to design out distortion-causing driver and system resonances, so you only hear the good sounds.
																	
																		Klipple motor optimization uses laser measurement technology to ensure a smooth excursion path at either end of the volume spectrum for uniform performance at both low and high volumes.
																	
																		Rustproof stainless steel hardware, durable butyl rubber surrounds and powder coated aluminum (in-ceiling) & painted steel (in-wall) grilles make RCi Series speakers suitable for high moisture areas like bathrooms, transitional spaces or even under eaves or in the ceiling of an enclosed porch. (RCi series are not suitable for exposed outdoor use. For outdoor speaker fun, use our Atrium® Series.)
																	
																		Paintable grilles let you build them in, and then forget all about them; RCi Series speakers practically disappear into any room.
																	
																		RCi Series speakers are timbre-matched to other Polk speakers to insure utterly seamless blending from speaker to speaker in systems that combine traditional and built-in speakers.

						SC80-IPR Features:
						 
					
						
							IP-ready SC Series models have standard wire connections for existing audio systems, and may be upgraded later to IP control; simply flip the easily accessible toggle switch to choose standard wire connections or IP control.
						
							Polk's exclusive Rotating Cam system ensures stable, secure, vibration-free placement with the turn of a screwdriver.
						
							Polk's proprietary, patented Dynamic Balance® technology allows our engineers to design out distortion-causing driver and system resonances, so you only hear the good sounds.
						
							Dynamic Balance silk dome tweeters, in aimable swivel housings, deliver clear and detailed highs, without fatigue, for greater accuracy and more realistic imaging.
						
							Paintable grilles & flanges make SC Series speakers virtually invisible.
						
							SC Series built-in speakers share cutout sizes and hardware components with other Polk built-in speaker series, so you can more easily upgrade your built-in speakers at any time.
						
							Durable, moisture-resistant materials like stainless steel hardware and a powder-coated, rust-proof aluminum grille allow you to install SC Series built-in speakers in extreme install locations like kitchens, bathrooms, and transitional areas like sunrooms and covered porches.
						
							The SC Series is timbre-matched to all other Polk loudspeakers, for mix-and-match system-building and seamless, speaker-to-speaker perfection.
						
							The SC Series features three of the most advanced built-in loudspeakers you'll find: A single compact built-in loudspeaker that brings actual dynamic stereo sound to locations where two speakers just won't work; two high performance IP-ready loudspeakers, allowing whole-home audio networking on a budget for the very first time, and a high performance built-in center channel speaker!

	Visually striking in five beautiful finishes; including Lacquered Gloss Black, Lacquered Gloss White and ‘Leather effect’, the perfectly proportioned 3050 is the flagship of the new 3000 Series. Improved twin 165mm Aramid Fibre/Paper cone drivers deliver exceptional bass extension and midrange openness, whilst the new '2 in 1', Concentric Ring Dome tweeter adds astonishingly clear and smooth high frequencies. Performance is further enhanced, both sonically and aesthetically, by its integral steel 'outrigger' plinth with floor spikes.

	The flagship 3050 is the perfect loudspeaker for larger rooms. It boasts the ultra-low levels of distortion, typically found of speakers costing three or four times its price. Not surprisingly, as a result it delivers truly unrivalled sound quality and value.

	The new Q Acoustics 3000 Series loudspeakers are vaunted as the Q Acoustics best ever range. Q Acoustics say: ""We also believe they are sonically the best affordable speakers ever produced"".
	
	The flagship 3050 is the perfect loudspeaker for larger rooms. It boasts the ultra-low levels of distortion, typically found of speakers costing three or four times its price. Not surprisingly, as a result it delivers truly unrivalled sound quality and value.
	The substantial sonic advances delivered by the new Q Acoustics 3000 Series loudspeakers are the fruit of extensive scientific research.
	 
	As with the previous 3000 series, every part of the new speakers is bespoke, optimised specifically for each new model.
	
	This powerful (rexcept the new 3070S subwoofe), 140watts rms, twin 170mm drive unit subwoofer will bring the full explosive majesty of blockbuster movie soundtracks into your living room. Naturally, being a Q Acoustics design, it will also accurately reproduce the fast 'twang' and detail of a double bass or any other low frequency musical notes. That’s why Q Acoustics is your best choice for both music and movies.
	This stunning package comprise: 1 pair of Q Acoustics 3050 Fronts, 1 pair of Q Acoustics 3010 Rears, 1 Q Acoustics 3090C Centre and a Q Acoustics 3070S Subwoofer
	 
	In the new 3050 5.1 Home Cinema Pack, Q Acoustics designers have surpassed themselves.
	 
	Its precision soundstage, powerful dynamics and rich deep bass make it the natural choice for both home cinema enthusiasts and discerning music lovers.

693;Q Acoustics BT3; IDR5.900.000,00 ; IDR-   ;fivestar;0;BT3 Bluetooth Stereo Speakers;"BT3 Bluetooth Stereo Speakers

	

	 

	What makes the BT3 speakers so special?

	Hidden within the Q-BT3 speakers is a high quality, 2 x 50 Watts per channel amplifier, a Bluetooth V4.0 wireless receiver (with advanced ‘aptX’ capability for improved sound quality), and a low distortion Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC), accessed via an optical input.

	For movie lovers wishing to hear ultra-low frequency effects, there’s a separate subwoofer output to connect your subwoofer of choice. A second line level input allows you to connect a CD, DVD, Blu-ray player or any other ‘line level’ source.

	""A brilliant audio solution for nearly every requirement""

	

	What’s the best way to use my Q–BT3 speakers?

	The best way to experience the full capability of the new Q-BT3 is connect it to your television or set-top box and enjoy it as a high quality, wireless hi-fi mini system at the same time! To make life even easier, you can control the volume and switch between inputs on your Q-BT3 either with the small, elegant, infrared remote control included; or by the remote controls which come with many satellite and cable TV boxes, (including UK ‘Sky’ and ‘Virgin’ models).

	 

	Where can I put my speakers?

	The Q Acoustic BT3 speakers can be placed almost anywhere. They can be wall mounted with an appropriate bracket or placed on a speaker stand, furniture or bookshelf. Therefore whether you want to experience the full force of the latest blockbuster movie or listen to your favourite music, one thing guaranteed is that the stylish Q-BT3 Bluetooth speaker system will enhance your enjoyment.

	 

	 

	How they work

	

	
		Can I use my iPhone or other Smartphone to connect wirelessly to my Q-BT3 speakers?
	
		For ultimate flexibility and convenience, we’ve incorporated state of the art V4.0 Bluetooth technology (with aptX for near CD quality sound) into the Q-BT3, which allows you to listen to music from any Bluetooth enabled Smartphone, Tablet or laptop. Then simply enjoy your music with the freedom and convenience that only a wireless connection can bring. This innovative product can be enjoyed in many different ways, from many different devices.
	
		Are these the best Bluetooth speakers around?
	
		We’re completely confident the Q Acoustic Q-BT3 Bluetooth speakers set the standard at their price. The new Q-BT3 isn’t a jazzed up iPod dock or modified table radios in disguise. As stated above, the Q-BT3 looks and sounds like a pair of genuine, superior quality hi-fi loudspeakers, for the very obvious and simple reason; that’s precisely what they are.
	
		Never miss what is going on
	
		The amazing thing about these is that you will never miss an important phone call or message again. You can listen to your music, however when your phone or device goes off, it dims the sound and alerts you. Therefore you can always stay connected, whether it is a message from your friends or an important business phone call, you can be alerted.
	
		Are these the best TV speakers around?
	
		Well, we’re too modest to say, but they’re certainly great value and will deliver an audio performance that comfortably outperforms typical soundbars and other dedicated TV speakers. Appearance wise Q-BT3 looks just like a pair of small, neat and stylish real hi-fi loudspeakers – because, under the skin, that’s just what they are (and a lot more!) Placed either side of your TV, the BT3 speakers can connect to your television or set-top box for you to experience fabulous TV sound quality. Q Acoustics BT3 is ideal for television and movie lovers alike and for those who want to ‘feel the earth move’, there’s a separate subwoofer output to connect your subwoofer of choice.
	
		Less clutter, more sound
	
		The Q Media BT3 has been specially designed to dramatically improve the sound from your TV. Volume levels can also be controlled via the remotes from many satellite and cable TV boxes, (including 'Sky' and 'Virgin' models). Therefore you can experience movies, music and sport like never before without searching for that ‘other remote’. In addition the BT3 has a built- in amplifier, therefore there is no need for a separate amp. This all adds up to less clutter in your lounge.
	
		Can they be used with my laptop or computer?
	
		Quite simply, yes! The BT3s make for great desktop speakers. They are small enough so that they will not clutter up your desk, and will deliver a performance that will ‘wow’ you. The BT3s take your listening experience to the next level. No longer will you have to complain about the poor sound quality, whether you are Skyping a friend, downloading music or watching something online.
	
		Why should I use these speakers for my laptop or computer?
	
		The BT3s deliver a sound far beyond that you get out of your laptop or computer. With the built in amplifiers the BT3s work particularly well for musicians that enjoy recording their own music as it is like bringing the recording studio to your very own home. They are also great for gaming, helping you get more involved in the experience, almost like you’re actually in the game itself.

	Q Acoustics 2070i 

	 

	Unusually at its price level, the Model 2070Si subwoofer is a completely DSP (Digital Signal Processing) driven system with highly efficient class D amplification. However this has meant we have been able to achieve an advanced level of functionality, as well as optimising the sonic performance, by undertaking all filtering and limiting completely in the digital domain. An example is the Speaker Type function switch, which alters the characteristic of the subwoofer's frequency response at the crossover point. This allows the subwoofer to be optimised for use with either ported speakers, like the rest of the Q Acoustics range, or infinite baffle models.

	The beautifully finished, compact and eminently affordable Concept 20 loudspeaker is designed for music lovers who wish to enjoy performances at their very highest quality. The Concept 20 changes everything. Their revolutionary ‘GelcoreTM Construction’ incorporated into their design means, for the very first time, music lovers can enjoy genuine ‘high end’ sonic performance at a very affordable price.

	The astonishing ability of the Concept 20 is best revealed when the loudspeakers are used in conjunction with the matching Concept 20 Speaker Stands which, to optimise performance, boasts a GelcoreTM layer in its top plate. This is both visually striking and is resonance-free to optimise sonic performance. With the option of either lacquered gloss black, or lacquered gloss white, not only will they sound amazing, but will also look great. Their versatile design means they are also at home on furniture, bookshelves or suitable wall brackets. Wherever you decide to place them, they will deliver an amazing experience that many of those with a higher price range struggle to reach.

We firmly believe the Concept 40 sets new standards, even outperforming many speakers in higher price brackets.

In common with the Concept 20, its award-winning ‘little brother’, the new Concept 40’s extraordinary soundstage, dynamics and sheer musicality is achieved by incorporating its bespoke drive units into a ‘GelcoreTM Construction’ cabinet. This State-of-the-Art, ultra-low resonance and beautifully lacquered cabinet design allows the drive units to perform at their very impressive best.

The low distortion drive units incorporate powerful oversized magnets to ensure wide dynamics and an ultra-fast transient response. The elegant tripod stand allows the Concept 40 to achieve perfect rigidity and floor contact which further enhances its performance.

Even the speaker’s attractive aluminium facia plate is not purely decorative. It’s part of an assembly which clamps a butyl rubber sheet to the front panel to reduce cabinet resonance still further.

We call these retailers the Q ELITE, many of which are centres of excellence for both Q Acoustics and sister brand QED and where you can be confident of receiving the ultimate Q Acoustics experience;"Founded in 2006, Q Acoustics quickly built a reputation for designing and manufacturing class-leading loudspeakers. Concept 500 is the culmination of Q Acoustics continual evolution and refinement resulting in what we believe is sonic perfection.


	
		Designed to appeal to discerning audiophiles, the Concept 500 achieves a perfect balance between art and science. It is a loudspeaker that is at once, stylish, contemporary, fine-sounding and astonishingly accurate. It couples low directivity with wide bandwidth, good sensitivity and sensible impedance. This makes the new Concept 500 both room-friendly and an easy load to drive, allowing amplifiers to deliver their best performance.


	 

	
		To create a stereo soundstage which gives as good an impression of width, depth and height as that found in a live performance requires high quality drive units, a well designed crossover and an accurately constructed cabinet. To achieve this, Q Acoustics formed a truly talented team with many years of experience in the design, engineering and manufacture of world-class loudspeakers. A combination that resulted in a state-of-the-art loudspeaker worthy of any high-end system.

		How to guide
	
		
	
		Step 1
	
		Select a suitable mounting location for the speaker taking note of the Warning Notices above. Using the installation template supplied mark the speaker position and cut the mounting hole. 
	
		Step 2
	
		Make sure all equipment is switched off.  The speaker cable should be stripped back ~10mm so that there are bare wire ends. Remove the packaging and protective dust cover from speaker and attach the speaker leads using the pushdown spring clip terminals at the rear of the speaker. The positive conductor should be connected to the red terminal and the negative conductor to the black terminal. For single stereo versions there are two sets of terminals for connection of left and right channels.  
	
		Note: Tweeter output level adjustment (‘P’ & ‘CW’ versions)
	
		It is recommended to leave the switch in the ‘0’ position for the initial sound check.
	
		
	
		Step 3
	
		Check that each of the 4 swing out clamps are rotated inwards. Push the speaker through the mounting hole and position flush with the ceiling. Whilst holding the speaker in place tighten each of the mounting screws using a No. 2 Pozidriv® screw driver in the order shown in the diagram (left). When an increase in resistance is felt the clamp is in position.
	
		Step 4
	
		Once the speakers are installed they should be tested before the grilles are fitted. The tweeter’s outer frame (not dome) should be pushed gently to achieve the desired tweeter position.  
	
		Step 5
	
		The 6.5” Professional in-ceiling single stereo speaker features a magnetic grille, locate the grille over the speaker bezel where it will be pulled into place. Note that square grilles may be positioned at any angle required.
	
		Some models feature a white backing cloth behind the grille
	
		
	
		to help minimize visual contrast with the ceiling. For the very best sound performance it is recommended that this cloth is removed before use. To remove simply peel away the backing cloth from the grille.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/753/1/qi65c.jpg;;;

	Q Install Weatherproof QI65CW

	This new Q Install 6.5” Speaker Weatherproof In-ceiling speaker features the very latest styling and mono speaker technology that is designed to meet the most demanding requirements of custom installers and their clients. Here at Q Acoustics we have used cutting edge industrial and acoustic engineering to create a striking bezel and grille design that clips magnetically into place, with the grille geometry being carefully optimized to ensure the perfect balance between sound and discreet appearance. As with all our Install products they feature protective driver dust covers and cloth backed grilles to facilitate painting. The HF is adjustable by + or - 3dB from a switch on the crossover. These speakers are clutter free due to being installed within the ceiling itself which gives you more space to do what else you may wish. These speakers can also withstand the harshest of elements that means you can enjoy them both indoors and outdoors, whilst using the mono speaker technology that gives you great sound. These allow you to be able to listen to music throughout your home or work place, both inside and outside, where this was previously not possible. These are great for adding your own personal touch, and bring in more of an atmosphere.

	 

	Features: 

	
		All the in-ceiling models boast a 6.5” (165mm) polypropylene cone. In the superior Performance variants this is an injection-moulded, mass damped, Nano Particle based driver cone, for lower distortion and colouration.
	
		Q Install has used cutting edge industrial and acoustic engineering to create a striking bezel and grille design that clips magnetically into place. Circular and square grille options are available to ensure the perfect match for each customers decor.
	
		Shallow depth requirement - all models are less than 84 mm deep.
	
		Q Install speakers utilize UL94 flame retardant materials.
	
		Adjustable high frequency output level feature in the Performance and Weatherproof models.
	
		Swivel tweeters allow fine-tuning of the installation acoustics.
	
		Tweeters are fully open on most models avoiding the use of protective bridges through the integration of Automatic Tweeter dome Recovery technology (ATR) that restores the dome after accidental deformation.
	
		Performance models feature a larger magnet assembly giving a 30% increase in program power handling capability. In addition precision components are utilized in the crossover filters, together with gold plated connectors.
	
		Grille geometry has been carefully optimized to ensure the perfect balance between sound and discreet appearance.
	
		Square and circular magnetic grilles are fully interchangeable without any need to change or remove the loudspeaker.
	
		All models are moisture proof, with the Weatherproof models (Qi65CW / Qi65CW ST) being suitable for more extreme use. Stainless steel fixings and corrosion resistant aluminium grilles are utilised together with fully sealed drive units to ensure no water ingress.
	
		Q Install speakers come carefully packaged with installation template and fitting instructions. All models feature protective driver dust covers and cloth backed grilles to facilitate painting should it be required.
	
		Many models are available as singles to aid installer convenience and reduce the overhead of excess stock.

	Installers may specify from a range consisting of an 8” and 6.5” two way full range unit and a D'Appolito array LCR which is also ideal for use as a centre channel. A passive 8” sub is also offered to complement the full range units providing additional bass extension when used with an appropriate A/V receiver and power amplifier.

	Airloc is QED's award winning loudspeaker cable termination method using specialist equipment. Put simply, this is the best termination method to use with QED loudspeaker cables.
	
	The science and engineering of loudspeaker cable doesn't stop with the cable. To perform as the designer intended, the cable needs to have the very best termination, as sound quality can be adversely affected by using inferior connectors.
	
	QED developed Airloc, a solder-free, airtight perfect fusion between the two metals of cable and plug. This 'cold weld' method allows the cable and plug to offer the optimum signal transfer and therefore, better sound quality. It also reduces contact resistance and ensures perfect long-term performance.";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/245/1/3090lg.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/245/2/spkairlocmain.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/245/3/airlock_banana_large.jpg;http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/245/4/connection.gif

		CABLES MATTER
	
		QED is the only UK manufacturer able to test HDMI cable designs beyond the scope of the current HDMI specification, which means it is uniquely placed to evaluate new technical innovations before deciding whether or not to introduce them into full production. QED has identified cable induced timing error, termed ‘jitter’, as one of the key differentiators between satisfactory and outstanding cables.
	
		These findings have enabled us to optimise transmission speed and jitter performance to ensure that both exceed the high standards we set for our Performance cable range.
		
		Naturally, because QED customers demand better, we have scientifically designed our cables to reduce jitter to the absolute minimum.
	
		QED Vs THE COMPETITION
	
		
	
		 
	
		The eye diagram above demonstrates that a competitor’s 3m HDMI cable narrowly passes the test and exhibits up to 103 pico seconds (ps) of jitter; enough to allow ‘bit errors’ into the video signal.
	
		 
	
		
	
		 
	
		The diagram below shows the results of an identical test on a 3m QED Performance e-Flex HDMI cable. The eye is much more ‘open’, showing superior headroom compared with the competitor cable. Importantly, Jitter is reduced to just 66 pico seconds, significantly reducing the incidence of bit errors reaching the TV and maximising the audio and video data transfer.

	Most ordinary patch cables are constructed to the Cat5e standard and are only specified for data rates up to 100MHz. The QED Performance Ethernet cable is an over-specified CAT6 UTP patch cable capable of data rates up to 250MHz - which gives it plenty of headroom when used in an HD Audio streamer application.

	 

	Asymmetric twist rates for reduced cross-talk

	A polyethylene former is used to physically separate each twisted pair into its own compartment within the cable keeping the geometry extremely uniform. This further contributes to the elimination of cross-talk within the cable and maintains the tight 100 ohm characteristic impedance demanded by the Cat6 UTP standard.

							The new optical fibre boasts half the signal attenuation per metre of the previous model, which means ‘Performance Graphite comfortably transmits the higher bandwidth signals demanded by today’s multi-channel digital audio links.
						
							 
					
					
						
							The cable features a stepped refractive index core that together with precision cladding techniques minimises light absorption and modal dispersion of single mode optical signals at the fibre boundary. 
						
							 
						
							This reduces the angle of incidence at which total internal reflection occurs so that more rays can propagate along the cable, which in turn makes for decreased jitter and improved audio data transmission.

			Utilises conductors of different diameters to carry the same audio signal. This provides an alternative path for high frequency audio components which might otherwise become time smeared in a single audio pathway.  QED cables above 2.5mm² cross sectional area utilise air core technology to obviate the skin effect by bundling several separately insulated smaller cores together to make up a larger CSA. If these conductors are arranged around a hollow central core of polyethylene the self inductance exhibited by the cable can be reduced to around half that predicted by calculation.

	Overview:
	THE QED Performance Audio 2 RCA interconnects feature high quality cable, 24ct gold plated plugs and zinc plated alloy barrels to deliver incredible audio performance.

	Signal integrity is guaranteed by using a low loss LDPE dielectric and 99.999% Oxygen Free Copper (OFC). 

	The twisted balanced geometry provides excellent immunity to external magnetic fields.
	A typical cable would employ the braiding as the negative conductor.

	Not so the Performance 2 which uses the braid only for screening. This further increases the cable’s noise immunity enabling it to deliver superb sound quality and sheer value for money.
	QED Performance Audio 2 interconnects are perfect to connect CD, DVD, tuner or other audio component to your amplifier or receiver to produce superior audio performances.

	CABLES MATTER

	QED is the only UK manufacturer able to test HDMI cable designs beyond the scope of the current HDMI specification, which means it is uniquely placed to evaluate new technical innovations before deciding whether or not to introduce them into full production. QED has identified cable induced timing error, termed ‘jitter’, as one of the key differentiators between satisfactory and outstanding cables. Because QED customers demand better, we have scientifically designed our cables to reduce jitter to the absolute minimum.

	The new Profile eFlex™ HDMI uses a new PVC variant dubbed ‘Ultra Matte’ which takes advantage of recent advances in plasticizer technology to produce our most flexible HDMI jacket material yet. With an all new miniature plug body design, the minimum clearance required for this cable is now a tiny 40mm which means it can be completely hidden behind any wall mounted or free standing display.

	New desirable design, improved flexibility, smaller head shell and now High Speed up to and including 3m!
	
	Profile retains the QED quality control and attention to detail that so impressed What Hi-fi? all those years ago - this means that the cable we designed, prototyped and measured is the same one that you can buy in the shops time after time. Using our state of the art HDMI test suite we can test and measure each new batch of cables so that, unlike some other manufacturers, we aren’t reliant on the variable quality of cordage on the world market at any particular time. This is why each cable sold comes with a QED Lifetime Guarantee.

	OVERALL PERFORMANCE

	 

	


	HDMI High Speed with Ethernet

	Applies to any HDMI cable that has been tested at an authorised test centre and has been found to pass the eye mask test at a combined data rate of 10.2Gb/s 340Mhz pixel clock. The cable must also have passed testing of the CEC and DDC connectivity and be compliant with HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel test procedure.

	 

	


	Low Jitter

	Jitter is the undesired deviation from true periodicity of an assumed periodic signal in electronics and telecommunications, often in relation to a reference clock source. A cable displaying low jitter has been measured at typically 75p.s

	 

	


	3D & 4K Compatible

	
		3D = compatible with 3D TVs; cable has a minimum bit rate of 4.45 Gb/s
	
		1080p Full HD = a video resolution with a bit rate of 4.45 Gb/s
	
		4K = Highest native video resolution offered by HDMI 1.4b; 4096×2160p24 36 bit/px = bit rate 8.03 Gb/s
	
		High Speed with Ethernet = 10.2Gb/s so any High Speed Cable supports all these resolutions

	Hi-Fi Choice Group Test Winner, August 2014

	Like most interconnects here, the Reference Audio 40 is a silver-plated copper affair, arranged in a special complementary way – the two conductors have different diameters, and this is said to give an alternative path for high-frequency audio signals to avoid time smear. The foamed polyethylene dielectric is claimed to reduce the amount of signal lost to cable capacitance. QED’s Analoc plugs are fitted, said to be a low eddy current design with copper instead of brass used. They feature an outer locking cylinder that needs to be screwed forward before the plug’s ‘blades’ can be locked onto the RCA phono socket, then the locking cylinder needs to tightened backup for a (very) secure fit. The Signature Revelation speaker cable uses 10 silver-plated oxygen- free copper central conductors, which are claimed to provide very low resistance alongside high levels of detail. These cores are separately insulated and arranged around a hollow core of polyethylene; QED calls this its Aircore technology and it’s claimed to reduce inductance.

	Sound Quality

	Before the QED loom, the panellists have taken a mixed view of the various wires played to them. They’ve found positives and negatives, liked some and been lukewarm about others. But two out of the three listeners express a strong preference for this set of cables, applauding it for its clean, open, even sound that doesn’t try to do anything too clever. Instead it is very accomplished at almost every facet of the music, and makes things look rather easy.

	“Everything is joined up,” says one panellist, and so it proves. The Lorde track plays better than it has through most others here. Although not necessarily the warmest or most expansive, it just seems to gel the bass with the rest of the music – which is something several others fail to do.It doesn’t sound too steely in the midband, giving a nice smooth sound to female vocals, and treble is crisp and finessed. Musically the loom works very well, the beat bouncing along in an enjoyable way. The result is a surprisingly easy listen, when previously the track hasn’t quite made sense.The REM tune is described as sounding, “head and shoulders better” by one panellist. There is a fine sense of depth to what can sound a pretty close and claustrophobic mix. One can hear lots of detail too, with the keyboard backing track coming through from the second verse, where previously it had been submerged. Tonally the QED isn’t the warmest or most sumptuous here, but it is very even and transparent and doesn’t seem to be trying to add or subtract anything much. This means that it’s likely to work well with a wide range of systems. Moving to the Duke Ellington piece and the pattern continues. One adoring panellist describes it as, “good bass rhythm and control, nice, cohesive, great sound, head and shoulders better”.Another of the panellists isn’t quite so enamoured; they appear to yearn for the expansive yet sumptuous midband of the Ecosse, and find the QED a little too anodyne and bland when playing Julian Lloyd Webber’s cello work. All of which just goes to show how much taste plays a part, but still this remains a superb result considering its low price

	FEATURES: 
	AIR GAP DIELECTRIC
	By Incresing the separation of the conductors inside the cable, and therefore the amount of ait between them, QED has created a low-loss Air Gap Dielectric. This technologu halves the dissipation and capacitance charatecristics of the cable, and result in numerous improvements - particulary where timing and thythmic accuracy are concerned
	
	X-TUBE TECHNOLOGY
	Forming the cable conductors into a tube-like shape around a hollow insulating rod in the centre of the cable equalises current densities, delivers very low indutance and presents a consistent, event load to an amplifier. The result is a cable that retains more of the finest musical detail, that handles rhytms and tempos in the most and musically satisfying way and the outpeform rival design costing far more.

	CRYOGENIC TREATMENT
	It is understood that cryogenic treatment results in the elimination of dislocations and fractures in the material'''s micro-structure. Trumpets and other brass instruments have been found to produce a better tone after Deep Cryogenic Treatment (below ''190 C, ''310 F) and it also extends their working life. Our extensive listening tests have shown that the cryogenically treated cable is preferred over the same cable without the treatment.
	ANALOCTM LOCKING RCA PLUGS
	The new QED Analoc' plug is a low eddy current design featuring small high purity copper
	conductors in place of the usual large volume brass body found in ordinary high quality plugs. This cuts down or eliminates the tendency for the changing magnetic field in the conductor to induce eddy currents which can affect the micro timing of the audio signal. Rhodium plating has the advantage for use as a plating material due to its superior hardness.

					Like most interconnects here, the Reference Audio 40 is a silver-plated copper affair, arranged in a special complementary way – the two conductors have different diameters, and this is said to give an alternative path for high-frequency audio signals to avoid time smear. The foamed polyethylene dielectric is claimed to reduce the amount of signal lost to cable capacitance. QED’s Analoc plugs are fitted, said to be a low eddy current design with copper instead of brass used. They feature an outer locking cylinder that needs to be screwed forward before the plug’s ‘blades’ can be locked onto the RCA phono socket, then the locking cylinder needs to tightened backup for a (very) secure fit. The Signature Revelation speaker cable uses 10 silver-plated oxygen- free copper central conductors, which are claimed to provide very low resistance alongside high levels of detail. These cores are separately insulated and arranged around a hollow core of polyethylene; QED calls this its Aircore technology and it’s claimed to reduce inductance.
				
					 
				
					Sound Quality
				
					Before the QED loom, the panellists have taken a mixed view of the various wires played to them. They’ve found positives and negatives, liked some and been lukewarm about others. But two out of the three listeners express a strong preference for this set of cables, applauding it for its clean, open, even sound that doesn’t try to do anything too clever. Instead it is very accomplished at almost every facet of the music, and makes things look rather easy.
				
					 
				
					 
			
			
				 
			
				 
			
				
					“Everything is joined up,” says one panellist, and so it proves. The Lorde track plays better than it has through most others here. Although not necessarily the warmest or most expansive, it just seems to gel the bass with the rest of the music – which is something several others fail to do.It doesn’t sound too steely in the midband, giving a nice smooth sound to female vocals, and treble is crisp and finessed. Musically the loom works very well, the beat bouncing along in an enjoyable way. The result is a surprisingly easy listen, when previously the track hasn’t quite made sense.The REM tune is described as sounding, “head and shoulders better” by one panellist. There is a fine sense of depth to what can sound a pretty close and claustrophobic mix. One can hear lots of detail too, with the keyboard backing track coming through from the second verse, where previously it had been submerged. Tonally the QED isn’t the warmest or most sumptuous here, but it is very even and transparent and doesn’t seem to be trying to add or subtract anything much. This means that it’s likely to work well with a wide range of systems. Moving to the Duke Ellington piece and the pattern continues. One adoring panellist describes it as, “good bass rhythm and control, nice, cohesive, great sound, head and shoulders better”.Another of the panellists isn’t quite so enamoured; they appear to yearn for the expansive yet sumptuous midband of the Ecosse, and find the QED a little too anodyne and bland when playing Julian Lloyd Webber’s cello work. All of which just goes to show how much taste plays a part, but still this remains a superb result considering its low price";http://www.audiocentre.co.id/product/2133/1/SignatureRevelationroll.jpg;;;

		In standard speaker cables at high frequencies current flow is highest at the periphery with rapidly deteriorating current density towards the centre of the conductor.

Designed for use where speed and convenience are the paramount concern, these connectors make the most of the Screwloc style termination providing a twin conductor clamp to suit cable diameters up to 3.25mm. The new forte plugs are 24k Gold Plated which has a resistivity almost as low as copper but more importantly does not oxidise in air.";"FEATURES AND BENEFITS

	
		
			
				
					The new Forte banana plug section is designed to maximise contact area throughout the wide tolerance range encountered in 4mm amplifier and speaker sockets. Some can be quite tight whereas others may be loose, so the spring loaded Forte blade is designed to fit into smaller and larger sockets with equal insertion force. This means that the contact area is maximised and the connection remains uniformly tight.
				
					 
				
					Screwloc spade plugs are 'duo' to enable secure contact with both standard and wide spade terminals.
				
					 
			
			
				
					Both the banana plugs and spades are made of brass which has roughly twice the resistivity of copper. For this reason the plug was devised so that its cross-sectional area would be at least double that of the cable to which it was connected effectively cancelling out the extra resistance of the plug material. QED then plates the connector with high purity gold which has a resistivity almost as low as copper but more importantly does not oxidise in air.

							X-TUBE™ TECHNOLOGY
						
							
								
									At low frequencies both X-TubeTM and conventional stranded/solid core speaker cables convey signals in a linear way. However, at high frequencies, X-TubeTMretains a near-linear signal transfer, whereas the conventional cable fails to conduct uniformly across the entire conductor area. The result is that X-TubeTMdelivers greater fidelity across the audio spectrum which would other wise be lost in ordinary cables.

			X-TUBE TECHNOLOGY
		
			 
		
			
		
			
				
					
						At low frequencies both X-TubeTM and conventional stranded/solid core speaker cables convey signals in a linear way. However, at high frequencies, X-TubeTMretains a near-linear signal transfer, whereas the conventional cables fail to conduct uniformly across the entire conductor area.
						
						In standard speaker cables at high frequencies current flow is highest at the periphery with rapidly deteriorating current density towards the centre of the conductor.
						
						 
					
						The effect of this is to reduce the actual cross sectional area of the cable at 15kHz to less than 75% of that at low frequencies. This results in higher distortion and compromises the performance of the cable.
						
						X-TubeTM with polycore technology exhibits much lower self-inductance and is therefore less affected by this problem. The polycore technology reduces loop inductance to levels only achievable using more costly and difficult to terminate cables.
						
						The result is more high frequency detail, less distortion and greater performance.

	The new Apollo CDP's uses the same electronic circuit found in the hugely successful Apollo-R CD player. Re-housed in our latest custom aluminium case to match the new styling of the Brio amplifier, the Apollo utilises Rega's own custom chipset and software offering a truly unique level of performance.

	Analogue & digital outputs
	Development of the analogue, digital and control domains ensured direct improvements of both analogue and digital outputs making the Apollo  a perfect partner for the Rega Brio amplifier and an ideal ‘CD format’ front-end for the Rega DAC. 

	Compact case design
	The Apollo is housed in our latest custom half-width case to match the Brio amplifier.
	The top loading mechanism offers ease of use and unrivaled reliability.

	Digital to analogue conversion
	The output amplifier of the Apollo uses the high specification Wolfson WM8742 digital to analogue converter, the same integrated circuit found in the multi-award winning Rega DAC's.

	Power supplies
	The Apollo uses ‘digital’ power supplies feeding the CD processor, optical block and laser diode amplifier.
	This is achieved by using the same high performance, low noise power supplies found in the same location within the Rega reference CD player. This vastly improves the playability, error correction and the ‘inner core’ processing of the digital CD ‘spinner’ part of the Apollo.

	Output amplifier
	The discrete output amplifier has a THD of 0.0025%, whilst at the same time improving the overall sound quality of the output amplifier.

	User interface
	The user interface is controlled by using a dedicated display micro-processor, which eases the workload on the main control processors giving an improvement in the control code stability, usability and improved speed of initialisation of the disc being played.

	Dedicated CD mini system remote control
	A new dedicated CD remote handset is supplied as standard which also has the advantage of Rega amplifier functionality.

	Apollo-R

	Design technology
	The Apollo-R is the result of many years of innovation, advanced software development and elegant engineering solutions researched by our highly skilled team of engineers and designers. It took the completion of two of our multi award winning products, the flagship Isis CD player and the Rega DAC to pave the way for a unique product we feel encapsulates everything the new Apollo-R should be.

	
	Design history
	The original Apollo CD player launched in 2005. It was a huge success selling approaching 20,000 units worldwide. The Apollo was a unique player featuring Rega’s own software and control system ensuring no other manufacturers player could sound the same. This key element is carried forward and improved into Apollo-R.

	
	Analogue & digital outputs
	Development of the analogue, digital and control domains ensured direct improvements of both analogue and digital outputs making the Apollo-R a perfect partner for the Rega Brio-R amplifier and an ideal ‘CD format’ front-end for the Rega DAC. The Apollo-R internal circuitry has also been improved by tightening the PCB layout.

	
	Compact case design
	Apollo-R is a top loading design housed in a custom compact aluminium case matching the Rega DAC and Brio-R amplifier. The Apollo-R is available in both black or satin silver finish.

	
	Dedicated CD mini system remote control
	A new dedicated CD remote handset is supplied as standard which also has the advantage of Rega amplifier functionality .

	
	Digital to analogue conversion
	The DAC and the output amplifier of the Apollo-R have been enhanced using the Wolfson WM8742 digital to analogue converter, the same integrated circuit found in the Rega DAC.

	
	Power supplies
	The ‘digital’ power supplies feeding the CD processor, optical block, laser diode amplifier and slicer have been enhanced. This is achieved by using the same high performance low noise power supplies found in the same location within the Isis CD player. This vastly improves the playability, error correction and the ‘inner core’ processing of the digital CD ‘spinner’ part of the Apollo-R.

	
	Output amplifier
	The discrete output amplifier has been tweaked to reduce the overall THD from typically 0.005% to 0.0025%, whilst at the same time improving the overall sound quality of the output amplifier.

	
	User interface
	We have improved the user interface control by using a dedicated display microprocessor, which eases the workload on the main control processors giving an improvement in the control code stability, usability and improved speed of initialisation of the disc being played which now matches that of the Isis CD player.

	Features :

	
		New Wolfson WM8742 DAC
	
		Enhanced Output amplifier circuit.
	
		Enhanced Digital power supplies.
	
		Improved User interface.
	
		Redeveloped Analogue & Digital outputs.
	
		CD remote with amplifier functionality.


	Brio-R

	The Brio–R embodies all the necessary ingredients. Substantial toroidal transformer, generous power supply components, rugged output stage, the use of film capacitors in the signal path and at all critical positions within the phono amplifier.

	New output amplifier 
	Developed by our engineers a newly designed output amplifier using a low source impedance emitter follower Class A driver stage. Based around a complementary pair of 150w Sanken Darlington output transistors, this combination forms a complementary emitter follower emulating Class A conditions with good thermal stability and lower standing currents in the driver stage.

	Remote Control
	Remote control has been added to the Brio-R without compromising the sonic design of the amplifier. This was achieved by keeping the remote circuit separate to the audio circuit and having its own dedicated power supply.
	There is no direct contact between the micro-controller and the signal path, the micro-controller controls the relays whilst the volume control motor uses DC control voltages.

	High quality components
	The Brio-R utilises the highest quality components and our engineers' experience to achieve the best sonic performance.
	Ensuring it is the most advanced and feature packed Brio to date.

	Improved power supplies
	During the Brio-R design process Rega reviewed the circuit and improved the low and high current power supplies, coupling and bypass capacitors. The phono stage has been improved to reflect the current improvements in the Rega Planar turntables, where the input sensitivity has been increased along with a revision of the
	sub 100Hz part of the phono frequency response.

	Custom Case & Design
	Housed in a brand new custom case the Brio-R draws on the pedigree of the previous three incarnations of this model.
	The sonic recipe for the Brio-R embodies the best in traditional audio circuits with excellent engineering practice.

	Q Acoustics is proud to introduce the new Concept 20 Loudspeaker.

	 

	

	 

	The 'Concept 20' is a special loudspeaker which goes beyond anything that Q Acoustics has achieved before. It's a beautifully styled product which we confidently believe delivers a level of sonic performance previously thought impossible at its price point.""

	To achieve this extraordinary performance, Q Acoustics' design team applied scientific methodology and advances in technology to address the problem of cabinet resonance; long recognised as the single biggest hurdle preventing speaker designers delivering true 'high end' performance at a reasonable price.

	The Brio has a completely new case to house its improved circuits and parts. It now sits in a fully aluminium two-part case which boosts the Brio’s heat sinking capabilities and improves on Rega’s already solid build quality and reliability. The new Brio has a cleverly integrated headphone socket specially designed to avoid interference with the audio circuit when not in use and as you would expect, a very high specification moving magnet phono stage is built in as standard.

	Throughout the design process the Brio has been meticulously improved in every aspect, from the quality of materials to the manufacturing process, to make this new Brio a step ahead in Rega’s engineering and design for amplifiers.

	Brand new case design.
	The sleek and minimal look was designed to bring elegance to Rega’s classic style but still harks back to the swooped features hidden away in Rega’s past amplifiers. Combining all these aspects makes this Brio case a unique standpoint amongst the competition.

	Re-designed circuit.
	Key improvements have been made to the circuits. The PCB layout has been fully upgraded to handle higher specifications for all critical parts. A second raw power supply has been added to provide further isolation between output stage and the driver stage/line and phono amplifiers. This improves the isolation between high and low level signal stages of the amplifier. Higher specification MUSES operational amplifiers have been used in the line and phono amplifier.

	Headphone Socket.
	For convenience, the Brio has the capability to drive standard hi-fi headphones from the internal amplifier. Adding a headphone socket was only possible by finding a way to reduce its impact on the main signal path so it doesn’t disrupt the overall sound quality. We have paid special attention to the switch that deactivates the main speakers.

925;Rega DAC-R; IDR11.500.000,00 ; IDR-   ;;0;The Rega DAC-R is a 16/20/24-bit at 32kHz to 192kHz digital to analogue converter. Incorporating an enhanced version of the Rega designed circuit, the DAC-R offers the highest possible resolution over all inputs including fully asynchronous USB with the addition of remote functionality.;"Overview :

	 

	
		Developed to be simple to set up and use, the Rega DAC-R is designed to optimise performance from any two channel PCM digital audio source. With the PC now widely accepted as a credible medium for storing and streaming music,the use of high quality lossless files such as WAV, FLAC and ALAC offer performance through the DAC-R equal to, and in some cases better than, Red Book CD. Great care has been taken to remove noise generated by the PC and other input sources. (During development
		this was identified as a major drawback with many DAC’s on the market today). The DAC-R is housed in a custom aluminium and steel case and boasts a pair of Wolfson DAC IC’s, three user selectable digital filters and one isolated asynchronous USB, two isolated Co-axial inputs & two Toslink SPDIF inputs. The DAC-R has been designed and engineered to integrate perfectly into any system and achieve the highest performance in its class. We hope you enjoy this Rega product for many years to come.
	
		The optical and coaxial input stage comprises a Wolfson digital receiver with a high stability, low jitter clock driving the receiver PLL. The receiver and PLL have their own dedicated power supplies.
	
		The DAC stage comprises a pair of parallel-connected Wolfson WM8742 DAC’s, that are driven via a buffer stage, which ensures the integrity of the data being fed to the DAC IC’s similar to the arrangement used in the Isis reference CDP. The USB input stage is comprised of a bit perfect XMOS USB Audio 2.0 with asynchronous clocking. The USB input stage feeds the Optical and Coaxial input stage via an isolating transformer giving total isolation from
		the host computer.
	
		The output amplifier employs a discrete differential, multiple feedback filter and output amplifier, with a high cut-off frequency for use with higher sample rates. We decided not to use a sample rate converter and process the data at the incoming sample rate which keeps the signal processing to a minimum. Jitter was minimised by synchronously clocking the digital data with our receiver PLL (removing any jitter from the input signal). All the capacitors associated with the analogue signal path are audio grade bypassed with MMK polyester capacitors, and low impedance conductive polymer capacitors are used for DAC decoupling. The power supply utilizes a toroidal transformer, fast rectifier diodes and again audio grade capacitors. There is a power supply for the control micro controller, separate from the digital & analogue audio stages. Special attention being paid to the inter IC control signals ensures the control data noise is kept to a minimum.

	The Elex-R is a sublime blend of the Brio-R design with the power circuits and advanced phono stage of the Elicit-R. Rega’s engineers have achieved the perfect balance of power, control and dynamics, delivering a performance that always puts the music first.

	Product Details :

	 

	Design Innovation

	The Elex-R is built to the highest standard and designed to deliver the best possible audio performance whilst remaining simple to use and easy to setup.The Elex-R is built into the full width Rega case with increased heat dissipation, which along with a larger transformer enables the Elex-R to deliver 90 Watts per channel into 6Ω and 72.5 Watts per channel into a design centre rating of 8.

	Our time, effort & money have been spent on developing the circuit and construction utilizing the highest specification of components throughout. As part of the design we have included useful features like pre-amplifier output, to enable the new Elex-R amplifier to be used in a wide combination of systems and have avoided superfluous gadgets such as tone controls or a headphone socket as they can obstruct the signal path and degrade the produced sound quality.

	The Elex-R has been built to Rega’s extremely high standards of reliability and quality to ensure many years of musical enjoyment. The primary function of an amplifier is to boost and equalize the low level signal generated by a phono cartridge, DAC and CD player or other source component to a level that can drive the loudspeakers. It is vital that the amplifier achieves this whilst minimising distortion, as this would directly affect the music. The distortion level is typically 0.007%; just under the clipping of the output.

	The volume control and pre-amplifier used in the Elex-R is designed to overcome the problems associated with the standard arrangement. This design uses a custom chip along with peripheral support IC’s like a microcontroller and a custom made rotary volume control.

	The Elex-R uses a combined feedback and passive volume control, where the feedback and input levels are varied to set the required volume level. The level and tracking between the two channels is set by the close tolerance parts in the pre-amplifier circuit and less by the actual potentiometer itself, thus keeping the mismatch of channels due to volume control tracking irregularities to a minimum.As well as keeping tracking irregularities to a minimum, this method also reduces noise and input overload as the control will only ‘use’ the required gain to amplify the signal.This form of volume control is normally only found in professional broadcast environments where accurate low noise control of levels is required.

	 

	Power Amplifier Technology

	The output amplifier used in the Elex-R, Elicit-R and Brio-R was born after extensive research by our engineers to develop a low source impedance emitter follower Class-A driver stage. This is based around a complementary pair of 150w Sanken Darlington output transistors. The technical and sonic improvement gained by the use of low impedance drivers is well known, however, it can feature high standing currents in the driver stage when using standard transistor configurations. By combining the low impedance driver with the Sanken Darlington transistors (with their imbedded thermal bias network running at a lower standing current) this combination forms a complementary emitter follower emulating Class-A conditions with good thermal stability with lower standing.

	Technology

	The output amplifier used in the Elicit-R was born after extensive research by our engineers to develop a low source Class A driver stage, based around a complementary pair of Darlington output transistors, forming an emulated Class A driver stage.

	 

	Features

	The Elicit-R includes a high quality, built in, moving magnet phono stage designed to maximise the potential of your vinyl system. A simple switch on the rear panel allows the same input to be switched to a secondary set at line level. This input is specially configured to offer further isolation and reduce noise. This makes it ideally suited for connection of more sensitive products such as an external MM or MC phono stage.

	If your system is not vinyl based, the same socket allows this line input to be used with any line level product (such as a CD player or DAC), ensuring maximised connectivity via the back panel. These features, coupled with Polypropylene capacitors throughout the signal path, improved power supplies and increased output power to 100 watts per channel, all housed in a brand new custom designed case, combine to give the best performance Elicit to date.

	
	 

	*The design of the Elicit-R benefits greatly from running warm. To ensure best performance it is recommended to allow the unit to reach optimum temperature before critical listening.

	Introducing the brand new Planar 1 Plus turntable - May 2018.

	We asked ourselves, how do we make the most successful turntable we have ever made sound better, be even easier to use and be more accessible to a wider audience?  The answer was simple; our engineers added a custom designed, high quality, moving magnet phono stage based around the multi-award winning What Hi-Fi? 5 Star Fono Mini. 

	For the Planar 1 Plus, we wanted to optimise this circuit for ultimate performance so we have removed the USB interface and used the money saved to improve what was already a stunning disc stage. 

	The new built in stage offers the ability to connect the Planar 1 Plus directly to almost any system that has a standard line input via a standard phono to phono cable (supplied) or phono to 3.5mm lead. Simply put, there is no need to purchase a standalone phono stage or use an amplifier with a built in stage. Your Planar 1 Plus will connect directly to any standard Line Level input (such as you would connect a CD player to).

	There are obvious audio advantages to housing the phono stage directly beneath the tonearm. The carefully shielded tonearm wire is soldered directly to the stage which prevents any unwanted pick up via the usual external cable between the arm and stage.

	The Planar 1 Plus benefits from all of the advantages of its sibling, the Planar 1, such as a low noise 24v motor, precision hub bearing assembly and hand made RB110 tonearm with a factory fitted Rega Carbon cartridge. Set-up remains possible in under 30 seconds making this the easiest to use, and most flexible Rega turntable to date.

	The TT-PSU is an ideal upgrade path for the RP3 or the RP1 (RP1 when fitted with the 24v motor upgrade kit).

	
		Product Detail
	
		Important: The TT-PSU can only be used with the RP1, RP3, P3-24, RP6, P5 and P7 turntables. It is not compatible with any other Rega or manufacturers turntables.
	
		The all new TT-PSU and motor anti-vibration circuit is a combination of the innovative P9 power supply along with an improved P25 anti-vibration motor drive feeding the P9 24v AC synchronous motor. The TT-PSU uses a remote ""wall wart"" transformer therefore keeping the sources of hum & noise well away from sensitive parts such as the cartridge and phono leads.
	
		The compact TT-PSU uses exactly the same high stability, crystal locked, low distortion, sine wave generator as is used in the heart of the P9 power supply. This, along with an efficient drive amplifier fed from stabilised DC power supply, generates a 24v AC balanced signal of less than 0.05% distortion, which is completely unaffected by any changes in the mains/line voltage and conditions. This then drives the turntables anti-vibration circuit which is situated beneath the turntable.
	
		The drive voltage for the motor is run along the power lead to the turntable motor which also carries the 33/45-RPM DC relay control voltage used to activate the anti-vibration circuit.

	The culmination of more than three decades of Rotel CD technology refinement, the RCD-1570 is the flagship CD player in Rotel‘s 15 Series.

	
		Product Description 
	
		
			
				Those who haven’t heard Rotel’s RCD-1570 might believe that there’s nothing new in CD players. Those who have heard it tell an entirely different story.
			
				Since 1982, when the CD was introduced, Rotel has been refining technology and evolving circuitry to bring you extraordinary sound. The RCD-1570, the outstanding CD player in Rotel‘s 15 series, focuses careful refinements to reveal even the most subtle nuances buried in a CD’s
				pit spiral.
			
				One of the RCD-1570’s most important features is the Wolfson WM8740 digital filter/stereo digital-to-analog converter. Originally developed for high resolution sources, it is the product of extensive research and real world testing and processes digital signals up to 24-bits in length at sampling rates from 8kHz to 192kHz. While word lengths and sampling speed may seem excessive for CDs delivering data at far lower rates, this high speed facility adds reserve capability to ensure proper reproduction under all circumstances. As the most crucial link between a CD’s digital data and the analog world in which we listen, this converter boasts significant attributes in addition to its superb high resolution capabilities.
			
				Another advance is the RCD-1570’s slot-loading disc transport. In addition to mechanical simplicity and improved reliability, this design isolates the CD itself from potentially destructive vibration modes that may affect musical definition. And from a purely aesthetic viewpoint, it adds elegance by simplifying the front panel’s appearance.
			
				The post-converter analog circuitry benefits from Rotel‘s decades-long experiences in crafting the finest sounding pathway from the D/A’s internal output to single and balanced rear panel connectors that bridge the gap between the RCD-1570 and down-stream components. All circuit components – resistors, capacitors, inductors – are chosen only after their positive contribution to sound quality were quantified and verified qualitatively by extensive listening sessions.
			
				All of these circuits draw on a power supply based on an oversized custom Rotel-designed and precision manufactured toroidal power transformer that, in turn, feeds precise rectifiers, tight-tolerance voltage regulators, and advanced Slit-Foil low-ESR storage capacitors, all globally-sourced to ensure musically accurate operation under even the most demanding conditions.
			
				XLR connectors provide balanced outputs, long recognized for their superior noise-rejecting characteristics while high quality RCA connectors provide an easy pathway to the myriad of components with single-ended inputs.
			
				This is all part of Rotel’s long-proven Balanced Design Concept. It’s yet another way of assuring you that the RCD-1570 evidences a level of attention that will make it part of your reference-level music system for years to come.

	PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

	Since 1982, when the CD was introduced, Rotel has been refining technology and evolving circuitry to bring you extraordinary sound from the familiar silver disc, As most music lovers have a subtantial collection of compact discs, a high quality CD player is still and important part of most music systems, The RCD-1572, the outstanding CD player in Rotel's 15 series, focusses careful refinements to reveal even the most subtle naucaes buried in a CD's pit spiral.

	The RCD-1572 elevates performance by utilizing a purpose designed and built CD mechanism along with other curcuit refinements. One of the RCD-1572's most important features is the Wwolfson WM8740 digital filter/strero digital-to-analog converter. Originally developed for high resolution sources, it is the product of extensive research and real world testing and processes digital signals up to 250bits in length at sampling rates from 8 kHz to 192 kHz.

	While wword lengths and sampling speed may seem excessive for CDs delivering data at far lower rates, this high speed facility adds reserve capability to ensure proper reproduction under all circumtances. As the most crucial link between a CD's digital data and the analog world in which we listen, this converter boasts significant attributes in addition to its superb high resolution capabilities.

	The post-converter analog circuitry benefits from Rotel's decades-long experiences in crafting the finest sounding pathway from the DAC's internal output to RCA and XLT rear panel conneectors that bridge the gap between the RCD-1572 and down-stream components. All circuit components - resistors, capacitors, inductors - are chosen only after their positive contribution to sound quality were quantified and verified qualitively by extensive listening sessions.

	All of these circuits draw on a powwer supply based on an oversized custom Rotel-designed and precision-manufactured torodial power tranformer that, in turn, feeds precise rectifiers, tight-tolerance voltage regulators, and advanced Slit-Foil low-ESR storage capacitors, all globally sourced to ensure musically accurate operation under event the most demanding conditions.

	This is all part of Rotel long-proves Balanced Design Concept. It's yet another way of assuring you that the RCD-1572 avidences a level of attention that will make it part of your reference-level music system for years to come

The 3.0 has a baffle characterized by waveguides, which allow for harmonious housing of the driver and give a vivid and engaging sound; the same inclined positionof the baffle facilitates proper timing in all environments, ensuring great listening every time. The tempered glass used in the base and top and the aluminium in the adjustable feet are the materials which unite the Venere line and give a contemporary edge to every model. As with all the speakers in the Venus line, the 3.0 also stands out for its ease of use and to set up as well as for its magical ability to ""disappear"" leaving only the music as the protagonist.

		It is the reviewer’s job not only to describe the sound of the component under test -- although that’s a huge part of it -- but also to provide some context for that sound. It’s naïve to think that products and their sounds exist in a vacuum, with no relation to other, similar products. There’s always something else vying for the buyer’s attention, and these days the competition is fierce in almost every category of consumer electronics, and at all the popular price points. Therefore, one of the most relevant assessments a reviewer can make for a reader is where a product ranks among its peers in the overall marketplace. This gives potential buyers an informed overview that they can use to help make wise buying decisions.
	
		For example, if you were to walk into a showroom and hear, see, and feel the Sonus Faber Venere 3.0, you might not guess their cost right off, particularly if you have any experience with high-end audio and know how absurdly high the prices can be. You might be surprised that the Venere 3.0 retails for $3498 USD per pair -- surprised by how little that is compared with how much it buys.
	
		One of the most interesting tests of the cost of a new product is the general public -- not just the subset of buyers who might be interested in that particular product. We’ve all had friends who gasp when we tell them how much our new preamp cost. Conversely, folks who have visited my home while the Venere 3.0s were playing have been quite accepting when told the retail price of the speakers -- a semi-remarkable feat for a high-end brand. Let’s face it: most of the high end makes no sense to the average guy.
	
		Design
	
		The 3.0 floorstanding loudspeaker is the largest model in Sonus Faber’s Venere line, which includes four other models: the 1.5 and 2.0 stand-mounts ($1198 and $1698/pair, respectively), the 2.5 floorstander ($2498/pair), and the Center ($798 each) and Wall ($698 each). These prices are for the standard finishes of Gloss Black or White Lacquer; the Venere 3.0 is also available in Walnut veneer for a reasonable upcharge of $500/pair.
	
		The Veneres represent Sonus Faber’s newest line and are their lowest-cost loudspeakers yet -- their price points were determined by designing the speakers in Italy but having them manufactured in China. One of the keys to the successful manufacture of speakers in China, I’m told, is how closely the contracting company monitors quality control on the production line. Companies that take care here can be rewarded with a finished product whose value far exceeds its retail cost. On the other hand, if quality control is all over the map or, worse, nonexistent, the reject rate, as well as poorly made and finished products reaching consumers’ hands, can be a disaster, financially and from a branding standpoint.
	
		
	
		The Venere 3.0 is a three-way, four-driver design measuring 45.6""H x 13.4""W x 17.3""D and weighing 47 pounds. Each driver is mounted in an asymmetrical waveguide; starting from the top, they are: a 1” silk-dome tweeter, which at 2300Hz hands off to a 6” midrange cone directly below it, which in turn is crossed over to two 7” woofers at 220Hz. The Venere 3.0’s crossovers are said to comprise a combination of first- and third-order slopes.
	
		The midrange and woofer cones look from afar to be carbon fiber, but Sonus Faber says they’re made of Curv, a thermo-molded polypropylene textile woven much as carbon fiber would be. The cones’ dustcaps are made of coated paper, however -- an interesting combination of materials that Sonus Faber states adds naturalness to the sound. The Venere drivers’ parts are sourced from outside vendors (the tweeter’s diaphragm, for instance, comes from German firm Dr. Kurt Müller GmbH & Co., aka DKM) and are assembled by others, too, but they aren’t picked out of catalogs -- you won’t see these drive-units in speakers from any other manufacturer.
	
		The Venere 3.0’s specifications include a sensitivity of 90dB SPL (2.83V/m), a nominal impedance of 6 ohms, a frequency response of 38Hz-25kHz, and maximum power handling of 300W, though Sonus Faber also states that the 3.0 can be driven by as little as 40W. The cabinet’s lyre-shaped cross section is preferred by Sonus Faber for its lack of parallel surfaces, which strengthens the walls and reduces the formation of standing waves. On the front is a flat-black front baffle; above it is a smoked-glass insert forming the top panel, below it a glass base on which the cabinet rests. The base screws directly into the bottom of the cabinet with wood screws (a step completed by the purchaser) instead of machine screws and accompanying steel inserts -- just about the only clue of the sort of trade-offs that had to be made to keep the 3.0’s cost down.
	
		
	
		The speaker’s vent is at the bottom of the front baffle. On the narrow rear panel (a strip, really) are two pairs of sturdy five-way binding posts, connected with a metal jumper that can be removed for biwiring or biamping. Beefy spikes fit into the glass base and tilt the speaker back slightly, to attain the optimal firing axes. Grillecloths attach to the front baffle via magnets.
	
		The overall fit’n’finish of the Venere 3.0 is remarkable for the price. My samples, in White Lacquer, looked modern and crisp, and the combination of materials and colors made for an attractive speaker that I can imagine working well with almost any room and décor. I saw no orange peel in the finish, nor could I find any flaws other than a few scratches on the spikes. I give the Venere 3.0 a solid “A” in terms of looks, build, and packaging.
	
		Sound
	
		I was hoping that, with the Veneres, Sonus Faber had not produced a line of speakers with syrupy, overwarm sound. I could see them doing that, in an attempt to hark back to the days when that type of sound was described as “romantic” and “inviting,” but that these days comes off as boring and nondescript. The Venere 3.0 was not problematic in that way. In fact, to my ears, its sound seemed quite straightforward. Right off, I heard a substantially neutral tonal character that was presented in a seamless fashion that indicated good integration of the drivers’ outputs.
	
		Beginning with the vocal range: the midband didn’t leave me wanting more tonal density. Recordings with prominent male and female voices were brought to the fore by the Venere 3.0s with effortless clarity. I listened to Andrea Bocelli sing Mascagni’s “Sancta Maria,” from the tenor’s Sacred Arias (16-bit/44.1kHz AIFF, Philips), and was impressed by how the Veneres projected his voice cleanly into the room, with clear intelligibility and smooth sound. With this track I’ve noticed that a speaker that’s reticent in the midrange will miniaturize Bocelli’s voice. The Sonus Fabers most certainly did not do that. In fact, when I switched to Enya’s “One Toy Soldier,” from her And Winter Came (16/44.1 AIFF, Reprise), her voice popped right out of the large electronically contrived soundstage. But what were most impressive with this track were the tick-tocks in the opening moments, which serve to establish the rhythm. These were snappy and crisp, sounding present in my room, with enough definition in the leading edges to make them believable. The Venere 3.0s were very good at keeping all the musical elements of this and other tracks separate and distinct, their four drivers delivering big-speaker soundstaging from a moderately sized floorstander.
	
		
	
		Which brings me to my next observation. The 3.0 is the top of the Venere line, and I believe Sonus Faber wanted this model to “bring it” when asked to do so. These speakers could produce sizable scale and substantial energy -- “Emmanuel,” from the Enya album, sounded majestic, swelling to reproduce an immense soundscape in my room. Enya’s voice was clear and distinct at all times, while the chorus came in to create a convincingly atmospheric soundstage of impressive height and depth.
	
		I’ve heard smallish floorstanders that sounded like large bookshelf speakers. These types of designs -- perhaps due to budget-constrained drivers -- always leave me with the feeling that I need to push the speaker a little harder than normal in order to get the exact sound I want out of them. In other words, they can sound as if they’re being held back by something. Mind you, the sounds of such speakers can be pleasant; they’re just not ultimately satisfying. The Sonus Faber Venere 3.0 went a long way toward ameliorating that problem in speakers costing under $4000/pair. I felt that, when I goosed the volume, the Venere 3.0s responded by effortlessly scaling properly with whatever music I was playing.
	
		
	
		When I decided to have Slacker Radio playing in the background, the Venere never gratuitously exposed the limited resolution of this sort of source. I listened to Ellie Goulding’s Lights (Slacker, Polydor), cranked the volume to 11, and plopped myself down in my listening seat. The beat was driving hard, and the peaks reached 95dB in my room, per my iPhone SPL meter. What this tells me is that the Venere 3.0 is a very “livable” speaker -- one you can listen to with recordings and sources of various qualities at a wide range of volume levels, without worrying about damaging the speakers or your ears. This is a very good attribute for a speaker that’s priced within reach of many Apple-buying consumers.
	
		Venere 3.0 frequency response at the listening position in the Music Vault
	
		When I moved back to the other end of the recording-quality scale -- Jerry Junkin conducting the Dallas Wind Symphony, with organist Mary Preston, in Sir William Walton’s Crown Imperial (24/176.4 WAV, Reference Recordings) -- I could immediately appreciate the resolution that the Sonus Fabers let through. Highs were very detailed, if not ultra-airy, and the midrange was crisp. Granted, the low-frequency foundation wasn’t as firm or as deep as I’ve heard from some much larger speakers with this track -- the sound of the pipe organ was not as grand or as room filling. After all, low bass is where the reality of two bass drivers measuring only 7” surfaces. They just aren’t going to play as loud or as low as a properly loaded set of 10” cones or a single 12” cone. Still, the bass the Venere 3.0s did produce was tighter than I’d expected, with good physical impact when the music called for it. Donald Fagen’s Morph the Cat (16/44.1 AIFF, Reprise) energized my room and gave me a satisfying sense of weight -- just what’s needed to make this song enjoyable.
	
		Considerations and conclusions
	
		If, as we’ve heard so many times before, loudspeaker design is a balance of trade-offs, then Sonus Faber’s Venere 3.0 is perhaps the most balanced design you can buy for anywhere near $3500/pair. It’s the speaker no one thought Sonus Faber could or would produce, and they’ve pulled it off: It can play large and loud, it can render recordings of both high and low resolution in enjoyable fashion, its substantially neutral tonal character won’t distract you with speaker colorations, and it can do all of this while looking spectacular. In this respect, it’s an easy recommendation for listeners both serious and casual. It might not be as revealing as, say, KEF’s R900, a model popular among SoundStage! Network reviewers (Roger Kanno and Hans Wetzel each own a set), but the Venere 3.0 costs $1500/pair less than the R900, and has one up on the KEF in terms of appearance -- the R900 looks boxy by comparison.
	
		Although I know that designers can be tempted to optimize one or two aspects of sound quality in order to give a speaker’s sound something “special” that the listener can latch on to, Sonus Faber has avoided that trap. With the Venere 3.0, no single aspect of sonic reproduction sticks out, and the result is a balanced sound that will appeal to average folk as well as to the audiophile.
	
		At the end of the day, the Sonus Faber Venere 3.0 is the speaker I would unhesitatingly recommend to any friend shopping for a pair of speakers costing up to $4500/pair. While there’s stiff competition above that -- the aforementioned KEF R900, PSB’s Synchrony One, the Paradigm Tribute -- I can’t think of any other speaker I’d rather own at the price. But even if you’ve budgeted $4500 to $6000, the Venere 3.0 should be in your short list of speakers to hear
	
		I imagine box after box of Veneres, stretching almost as far as the mind’s eye can see, ready to ship to waiting customers. This speaker is a big deal for Sonus Faber, and for the high-end community at large.

	One Subwoofer to Rule Them All. Introducing the PB16-Ultra.

	An unrelenting passion for breathtaking bass performance and engineering perfection guided every aspect of the PB16-Ultra subwoofer’s development. Groundbreaking technology, rigorous design and extreme testing in real world and laboratory environments allowed SVS to achieve unmatched low frequency extension and output capabilities all while keeping it amazingly detailed and articulate. The culmination of all SVS design advancements, PB16-Ultra represents an incomparable bass experience. Nothing else comes close.

	Masterful Engineering. 3 Game-Changing Subwoofer Innovations.

	One of these groundbreaking innovations would’ve been enough to make the PB16-Ultra an engineering tour-de-force, but the combination of 3 subwoofer firsts propels the SVS PB16-Ultra into the pantheon of all-time great audio products.

	

	Massive New 16-inch SVS Ultra Driver with Unprecedented 8-inch Edge Wound Voice Coil.

	

	When designing the biggest and most formidable driver ever used in an SVS subwoofer, it was of utmost importance to meet or exceed the same supreme standards of control and accuracy as every other subwoofer SVS manufactures. One huge advancement that allows the PB16-Ultra to handle the crushing force of a 16-inch driver is the 8-inch edge wound voice coil, the largest ever deployed in a consumer subwoofer. This innovation ensures ultra-low distortion and pinpoint control at the highest drive levels resulting in incredible output and low frequency extension. By nature, larger drivers are more difficult to control, but the unprecedented voice coil design ensures accuracy in frequency response and speed in transients without ever sounding boomy.

	Pushing the driver are four massive, dedicated toroidal ferrite magnets that unleash a staggering 95mm peak to peak excursion and the highest levels of motor force and palpable SPLs. The light and rigid 16-inch Ultra driver cone consists of a premium fiberglass resin composite with optimal stiffness to mass ratio to maximize movement of air and sonic energy without ever distorting or losing control.

	Stunningly Powerful, New Sledge Amplifier with Fully Discrete MOSFET Output and 1,500 Watts Continuous, 5,000+ Watts Peak Power.

	Conservatively rated at 1,500 watts continuous, 5,000+ watts peak power, the PB16-Ultra Sledge STA-1500D amplifier’s 64 Amp 200-Volt MOSFETs are the sonic muscle behind arguably the most powerful and highest fidelity subwoofer amplifier ever developed. Discrete MOSFET output unbridles the nearly limitless power in the Sledge amplifier and pushes the 16-inch driver to extreme levels of performance. They also represent an upgrade over the less robust integrated circuit output stages found in nearly all other Class D subwoofer amplifiers.

	Effortless power must be harnessed to ensure refined behavior and pristine output at the most demanding drive levels. To achieve this, the PB16-Ultra subwoofer uses the audio industry’s most advanced 50 MHz Analog Devices Audio DSP with 56bit filtering to handle the nearly limitless power, only unleashing the perfect amount of low frequency energy at just the right time.

	Innovative New Smartphone App for Subwoofer DSP and Control.

	

	Compatible with Apple® and Android® platforms, the innovative PB16-Ultra smartphone app unleashes the full depth, force and nuance of the world’s finest subwoofer. The groundbreaking SVS subwoofer app controls all DSP functions and conveniently stores custom presets. It’s the easiest way ever to fine tune bass surpassing 16Hz at reference volumes from the comfort of your favorite seat.

	For added convenience, 2-way feedback shows updates in real time on both the app and subwoofer interface and Bluetooth connectivity allows adjustments to be made even when the subwoofer is not in sight. Control is also available via IR remote and an intuitive front panel display.

	the largest ever deployed in a consumer subwoofer.

	This innovation ensures ultra-low distortion,

	efficient heat dissipation, exceptional linearity and nearly zero power compression.

	By nature, larger drivers are more difficult to control, but the unprecedented voice coil design ensures accuracy in frequency response and speed in transients without ever sounding boomy.

	Pushing the driver are four massive, dedicated toroidal ferrite magnets that unleash a staggering 78mm peak to peak excursion

	and the highest levels of motor force and palpable SPLs.

	The light and rigid 16-inch Ultra driver cone consists of a premium fiberglass resin composite with optimal stiffness

	to mass ratio to maximize movement of air and sonic energy without ever distorting or losing control.

	Stunningly Powerful, New Sledge Amplifier with Fully Discrete MOSFET Output and 1,500 Watts Continuous, 5,000+ Watts Peak Power.

	Conservatively rated at 1,500 watts continuous, 5,000+ watts peak power,

	the SB16-Ultra Sledge STA-1500D amplifier’s 64 Amp 200-Volt MOSFETs are the sonic muscle behind arguably the most powerful and highest fidelity subwoofer amplifier ever developed.

	Discrete MOSFET output results in superior handling and tighter control of the immense amplifier power and represents a major upgrade over the integrated circuits found in nearly all other Class D subwoofers.

	Effortless power must be harnessed to ensure refined behavior and pristine output at the most demanding drive levels.

	To achieve this, the SB16-Ultra subwoofer uses the audio industry’s most advanced 50 Mhz Analog Devices Audio DSP with 56bit filtering to handle the nearly limitless power, only unleashing the perfect amount of low frequency energy at just the right time.

	Innovative New Smartphone App for Subwoofer DSP and Control.

	

	Compatible with Apple® and Android® platforms,

	the innovative SB16-Ultra smartphone app unleashes the full depth, force and nuance of the world’s finest subwoofer.

	The groundbreaking SVS subwoofer app controls all DSP functions and conveniently stores custom presets.

	It’s the easiest way ever to fine tune bass surpassing 16Hz at reference volumes from the comfort of your favorite seat.

	For added convenience, 2-way feedback shows updates in real time on both the app and subwoofer interface and Bluetooth connectivity allows adjustments to be made even when the subwoofer is not in sight.

	Control is also available via IR remote and an intuitive front panel display.

On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the birth of Unison Research, we pay homeage to these historic devices by offering the simply Two and the Absolute in a limited and numbered \""Anniversary\"" Edition.";"Unison Research Triode 25 Integrated Amplifier
	Theree amplifiers symbolize the success of Unison Research: the Simply Two, the Triode 20 and the legendary Absolute. On the accasion of the 25th anniversary of the birth of Unison Research, we pay homeage to these historic devices by offering the Simply Two and the Absolute in a limited and numbered ""Anniversary"" Edition. Wwe/ve also decided to offer a completely new version of the Triode 20 and named it, quite approriately, the Triode 25.
	
	The Triode 25, like its predecessor, is a push-pul amplifier that utilizes EL34 tubes in the output stage. The push-pull circuit includes a final stage with two power tubes intended for the amplification of the positive half-waves, respectively, and of the negative hald-waves of the audio signal. The task properly recontructing the audio signal is then assigned to the output transformer which, thanks to its symmetrical structure, allows for a highly linear signal. Here are some of the more important and significant benefits of a oush-pull structure in this type of amplifier design.
	- Higher output power
	- Higher efficiency and therefore less heat generated, with positive effects on the durability of the output tubes as well as a significant savings in energy costs
	- No static polarization of the output transformer, resulting in better performance of this section
	To ensure high quality sound in an amplifier with a push-pull configuration, however, it is essential that all individual ampplification stage, especially the two semi-output amplifier, are carefully designed and contructed to prevent the formation of dangeroud and compromising odd-order harmonic distortion. This is even true for the output transformer.
	The new Triode amplifier 25 has experienced a long and painstaking design and testing period despite the considerable experience already gained in the contruction of its predecessor, the Triode 20. The Triode 25 can operate in two modes: triode and pentode. The latter is capable of delivering power output of over 45 watts per channel with a load of 6 ohms with harmonic distortion extremely contained across the entire audio band.

		The Evolution of a Success...
	
		Based on the CD-S6, which was one of our best CD-players for almost one century, we have decidedto develop this device further technically and to improve it naturally.In the design of the tubeLine (just a little higher in comparison to its predecessor) the new CD-S7 is presented. In the inner structure, however the “new” one differentiates itself basically from its predecessor.Thus a Sanyo drive ensures a clean and improved scanning of your CDs. The Sanyou Chip DA11 ensures the reading of the data; the software belonging to it has been developed by us.
		
		The PCM1796 of the trademark Burr-Brown functions as D/A-converter. The result:clear better soundwith even clear better dynamics as well as improved decoder-precision (24bit, 192 kHz).


	
		
	
		
			The analogous signal will be processed in a fully balanced manner. All the 4 signal linesare provided with their own filter and own amplifier unit. This improves the sound clarityand increases the dynamic range.
			
			The CD-S7 would not be located in the tubeLine,when no tubes would be used. Thus we now use 2 tubes of the type 12AX7 in the si-gnaling pathway. The sound will become warmer and silkier through this; however it willnot have a washed out effect or display any obscurities in the sound. No, transparencyand spatiality will be clear after the first sounds.We have also took a look on the supply of power and voltage and made improvementsagain. A new oversized toroidal transformer always provides sufficient services, and a6Z4 tube ensures the stability in the voltage.Components of well-known manufacturers, gold-plated tube sockets and gold-platedconnections round off the overall picture of the CD-S7.

	The CD-S8: A Class On Its Own!

	In this product line all was achieved that stands for the Vincent philosophy: listening to music, not matter at which volume level.

	 

	Pleasure, not matter at which volume level.
	The CD player CD-S8 captivates with its music playback without neglecting the details. In combination with pre-amp SA-T8 and mono blocks SP-T800 the CDS8 builds a detailed and real stage in the listening room, which precisely reproduces the positions of the musicians. This without dissecting the music, it always sound complete and is fun to listen to, as usually only with significantly more expensive components or live. It was a logic consequence to connect the Combi SAT8 and SPT-800 to an adequate signal source. After a long development period and even more listening sessions we are now proud to present the Premium Line CD player CD-S8. Even more three-dimensionality, more precise signal resolution, more musical reproduction. This was our aim, and we are proud to say that we achieved it.

	Classy Two-Chassis Hybrid Design Phono Stage

	Vincent Audio's new two-chassis PHO-700 MM/MC phono stage puts its low-noise power supply in a completely separate chassis for pristine signal quality. It will reward you with an amazing vinyl experience. Separate cases for audio and power supply circuitry help isolate the signal chain from AC distortion and interference.

	The PHO-700 performs its RIAA correction with high precision for ultra-low distortion and uses the highest quality audiophile parts, inside and out. It has a single phono input, which can be switched to accommodate low-output MC cartridges or MM/high-output MC cartridges.

	""It Blew Me Away""

	""The PHO-700 may be one of Vincent’s best designs to date, meeting the challenge of building a phono stage with low-noise and as much loss-free transmission as possible,"" raves Peter Stanton-Ife in his HifiPig.com review for January 28, 2015. ""[It] generally blew me away on all sorts of music. I had to remind myself of the cost of this phono stage… I genuinely struggle to think of a phono stage below £1000 which will best this unit…""

	Vincent's Best Compact Preamp to Date

	For more than ten years, Vincent Audio has been successfully designing and manufacturing phono preamplifiers. The new PHO-700 may be the German company's best compact preamp to date. Often overlooked in the digital era, vinyl has recently been experiencing a dramatic comeback. The preamp is a necessary component, which allows you to connect your turntable to receivers, amplifiers, and other gear that lack a dedicated phono input.

	In a record player, the output signal is at amuch lower level than the signal from a line stage component, such as a CD player. So the challenge in building a great sounding phono stage is to provide a low-noise and loss-free transmission. Vincent met that challenge and exceeds expectations with the PHO-700.

	Highly Regulated Separate-chassis Power Supply

	Vincent has deliberately omitted the typical 'wall-art' AC power adapter, opting for a specially designed and highly developed outboard power supply instead. Feeling is believing. The power unit has impressive heft when held in the hand and testifies to the quality of the transformer, metal chassis, shielding, and other components.

	This no-compromise approach to power helps the PHO-700 to achieve its low-noise performance. The PHO-700 uses the same power supply that is already employed to great advantage in Vincent's critically acclaimed PHO-8 phono preamplifier. It is connected to the separate-chassis audio circuitry using a nine-pin DIN cable. The voltage is highly regulated and filtered, so that the ripple and hum found in unconditioned AC power right out of the wall will not reach the phono section. The delicate audio circuitry only receives clean power.

	Vacuum Tube Circuitry for Smooth, True-to-Life Sound

	The PHO-700 delivers the luxurious sound that can only be obtained with finely-made vacuum tube equipment as well as the power associated with solid state designs, including speed, reliability, and control. That's a difficult combination to beat, especially once you factor in the affordable price.

	Look inside the front panel 'window' of the PHO-700 and you'll see a 12AU7 vacuum tube used in dual triode mode. This contributes to the warm, true-to-life sound. High-quality components from Nichicon, Wima, and other companies improve the parameters of noise ratio and amplification.

	I’ve listened to a lot of hybrid amplifiers in my time, but the truth of the matter is that they almost always sound like solid state amps. The SV-226 MK II deftly defies that expectation; it melds the sweetness of tubes with the power and control of transistors. For this kind of money that’s nothing short of phenomenal.”
	Steve Guttenberg, AVguide.com

	 

	Designed in Germany and hand-built in China, the Vincent SV-226 Mk II is a really big amplifier. There’s a retro quality to its machined metal faceplate and knobs, which feel great, by the way. And while it may not be obvious when you first look at it, the SV-226 Mk II is a hybrid, tube/solid state design. It uses three 6N4 tubes (equivalent to the more common 12AX7 tube) in the preamp section and highly regarded Toshiba power transistors in the amp. Vincent’s parts quality selection seems first rate; for example, the amp uses expensive capacitors and extremely precise metal film resistors in the signal path.

	The power transformer is huge and the power supply is considerably beefier than what you’ll find in most affordable integrated amps, which is why the SV-226 MK II doubles its 8 ohm rated power of 100 watts to 200 watts into 4-ohm speakers. The heavy-duty speaker connectors can accommodate burly audiophile cables, no problem.

	The bass and treble controls (which are defeatable) and it also includes a Loudness button! Activate the loudness control for hushed late-night listening sessions and it’ll boost both bass and treble; it really does work like a charm.

	The all-metal remote is beautifully machined and designed with the cover is held in place with powerful magnets.

	Tip: The SV-226 Mk II has enough current and power to drive pretty much any speaker upto about $5000.

	Through the Vincent, the White Stripes’ thick, muscular rock comes on like gangbusters. The SV-226 Mk II’s low end is airy and wonderfully nimble, light on its feet, yet plumbs the depths of the bass. There’s no “tubey” mellifluousness down there, thank you very much! Next I popped on Neil Young & Crazy Horse Live at the Fillmore East 24/96 DVD-Audio [Reprise] and I’m here to tell you this is one of those discs that just sounds better and better the louder I play it. The SV-226 Mk II was happy driving my Dynaudio speakers to room-filling volumes without complaint or undue duress.

	Bob Belden’s jazz epic, Black Dahlia [Blue Note SACD] is an amazing piece of work. The mood shifts from track to track, ranging from a steamy Los Angeles landscape, to slinky nightlife, lost love, and a disturbing murder scenario—all rendered in opulent detail. At one point a lone bongo, set against a curtain of harps was so perfectly delineated that it took on a three-dimensional presence on the left side of my room. Dahlia is eerily cinematic in its sweep, and the SV-226 Mk II brought every luscious bit of it home to me.""

	There is a proverb that says: ""If it works, do not fix it"". It's Vincent supporters of. There is also another way of looking at things which can also be used without clashing with the proverb. There are some who believe that ""if it works well enough, then what is the problem?"".

	Vincent has the philosophy that ""good enough"" is not a goal, it's not even a step on the way. Why settle for ""good enough""? Vincent has the attitude that if you can get it to work great, why not do it? Therefore, there is uneven time between new models, or MK versions from Vincent, who do not need to come up with new models to maintain customer attention. Vincent comes only with new models when there is audible or technical improvements, or other professional reason.

	Hybrid Stereo Integrated Amplifier

	From these developments and continuous improvements from a certain point onwards the name MK arises, and marks a new leap in the sum of many smaller and larger developments. In this way the SV-236MK developed. Based on the outstanding characteristics of SV-236 a unit was enhanced, which advanced in performance only by parts of the above-mentioned changes. The increase is around 50W, from 100W at 8 Ohm to 150W at 8 Ohm. As a result the listener enjoys clearly improved performance and dynamics, the sound simply gets even better, more superior. Even the power adaptor was revised and provides for sound improvement. The new voltage stabilization circuit is introduced in the 
	 SV-236MK. Consequently the sound has clearly improved, close to tube sound and thus much higher musicality. A further result is the simpler and improved circuit layout, the signals follow the simplest paths free of disturbances. Sound-defining parts were optimized and greatly improved. Generally it was reverted to proven components, where the signal could be affected relevantly. Thus for example German WIMA condensers are employed. All these changes are reflected in the exterior design and so even here changes were made. The casing was adjusted to the SV-234 casing, consequently the customer gets a clearly higher value and quality to the touch at first sight.

	How to improve an unbeatable unit? Very easy, just listen to the customers wish. That's how the SV-237 becomes the SV-237MK. The big change is that we replaced the USB input on multiple wish by an coax and optical input. These inputs are more suitable for daily use and offer more possibilities for connections. The unique circuit of Frank Blöhbum was not changed.
	Under the leadership of Frank Blöhbaum, who is the developer of the Thorens electronics and the Auto-Bias control of the T.A.C. tube amplifiers, the circuit design was completely revised and improved. Thus, in the output stage section a phase reserve of 90 degree was reached by making various changes, This phase reserve provides  a much better transient response to complex loads (loudspeakers). Because the amplifier always works virutally during normal operation in state of the transient oscillation - Music represents transient pulses - the improvements can be heard elementary. Musicality and sound are much better than its predecessor. Even the most difficult loudspeakers can be powered easily. The amplifier always dominates the complex load (loudspeaker) without sounding strained.
	The preamplifier section was fitted in the second stage with 6N1P tubes. The greater voltage level provides better signal stability, This results in a higher spectral purity of the signal which causes a further improvement in fine detail in the sound. Here, the tube-like greatly improved signal to noise raio. Its result in an excellent playback quality also on high efficiency speakers such as the Impulse series of Dynavox: Noise was once. Enjoy explosive live performance as a result of excellent dynamics. Moreover, the volume control has been finely adjusted. Thus, the volume level can be set precisely using remote control.

	good single-ended triode amplifiers – at a much higher level of performance and purity.

	Despite the carefully designed combination of both amplifier parts, the connection between these

	amplifiers can be disconnected externally and, if necessary, an external DSP can be inserted for room

	correction. Due to the output impedance of the tube pre-amplifier, which is again significantly reduced

	compared to the SV-237MK, it can provide a neutral sound when driving common connection cables

	and input impedances, e.g. of the DSP.

This, combined with award-winning sonic know-how, delivers levels of convenience and performance that separate the Diamond Active Series from the rest of the wireless speaker crowd.

	What Models Are There?

	The Diamond A2, is the larger floorstanding speaker in the series at 91.2cm high. The Diamond A1 is the smaller ‘bookshelf’-size speaker (31.5cm high) in the range. The Diamond A2 speakers are supplied in a pair with accompanying Diamond H1 Hub. Within each speaker is a 50W amplifier in each speaker to deliver a combined ‘system power’ of 100W.

	How Do They Work?

	Wharfedale’s Diamond Active Series speakers work differently to conventional wireless or powered speakers. They include an advanced wireless hub, to which the playback device is paired via Bluetooth (with support for the sonically superior aptX codec). The H1 hub then conveys the left and right audio signals to the appropriate speaker via uncompressed wireless transmission, allowing greater freedom in terms of positioning. As well as removing the need for the speakers to be connected together via a cable – that’s why we call it ‘true wireless’ – the fact that each speaker incorporates its own 50W amplifier helps to ensure consistent, fully optimised stereo sound.

	To enable interference-free wireless transmission, the H1 hub avoids the often-crowded 2.4GHz frequency band, focusing on 5.8GHz instead. The intelligent wireless module has the ability to switch automatically between frequencies when required, thus avoiding any local interference wherever the speakers are sited. Each speaker may be placed up to 20m from the hub, giving exceptional positioning flexibility; the only other siting requirement is that both speakers, with their dedicated amplifiers, need to be plugged into the mains.


	Drivers

	The Diamond A2 sports two proprietary 165mm bass/mid drivers, made with woven Kevlar – as featured in the Diamond 200 Series. The cone incorporate semi-elliptical ‘break-up’ areas, which smooth the response throughout the audible range, while rear-firing reflex ports augment the bass.

	The 25mm fabric dome tweeter is also derived from the Diamond 200 Series, incorporating a precision-drive magnet system and a meticulously designed waveguide around the diaphragm for optimal dispersion. The drive units are combined via a sophisticated crossover network, specifically developed to optimise the performance of the Diamond Active speakers’ integrated amplifier/driver configuration, delivering a cohesive performance that is bold and engaging, yet also impressively refined.

	All Diamond Active Models are available in a choice of Black Leatherette with High Gloss White or a High Gloss Black Front Baffle.

	High sound quality circuit design based on the ToP-ART (Total Purity Audio Reproduction Technology) concept

	 

	
		
			
				
			
				 
		
	
	
		
			ToP-ART Design and ART Base Ensure Optimum Sound When processing and transmission of the audio signal is simple and direct there is less chance of it being affected by noise and distortion. Yamaha’s amplifier design technology called ToP-ART features an I/O (input to output) Direct Symmetrical Design, with left and right channels organised in a straight, symmetrical layout for highest signal purity. In addition, the ART (Anti-Resonance and Tough) Base bottom chassis and a solid centre bar provide high-rigidity support and vibration damping. These Yamaha design innovations contribute to this amplifiers’ rich audio reproduction with abundant musicality.
	


	High Quality Parts for Outstanding Audio Performance

	 

	
		
			
				
			
				 
		
	
	
		
			Custom-made power transformer, custom-made block capacitors, two direct signal path speaker relays, one-point grounding system, aluminium-extruded heat sinks and other top-quality parts effortlessly handle demanding audio signal conditions. The quality of each individual part, as well as how they work together, basically determines the sound quality of any component. Yamaha uses only very high quality parts, carefully selected and tested.
	


	Created by Yamaha's Rich Experience and Tradition, and High Technological Expertise

	
		
			Yamaha, with a long history of over 125 years as a musical instrument maker, also has a high reputation for HiFi components. The A-S301 is created by taking advantage of this rich experience and high technological expertise. Based on the concept of “Natural Sound”, for reproducing all music as it really sounds, and built with scrupulous care from circuit design to basic sound production, even though an entry model it reproduces high sound quality and musically rich sound.
	


	Pure Direct Mode for Greater Sound Purity

	
		
			The Pure Direct mode causes the music signals to travel the shortest possible circuit route, bypassing the buffer amp and the tone, loudness and balance controls to virtually eliminate any signal degradation for the purest sound quality.
		
			 
	
	
		
			
				
			
				 
		
	


	Continuously Variable Loudness Control

	 

	
		
			
				
			
				 
		
	
	
		
			The A-S301 also feature a new analogue loudness control on the front panel that uses electronic volume for higher sound quality, which lets you adjust the loudness effect as desired. Separate from the overall volume, this controls the balance of the low- and high- frequency sounds, providing full tonal range at any volume level, compensating for the natural loss in the human ear of high and low frequencies at soft levels.

			The A-S301 is equipped for digital audio input with both optical and coaxial terminals. The optical is for receiving audio from a TV, and the coaxial for receiving audio from a Blu-ray player. The audio stays in the digital domain, giving you pure, pristine dynamic sound for all your entertainment sources, from sports and other programmes to movies and concerts.
	


	Connection for YBA-11 Bluetooth Wireless Adapter

	
		
			With the YBA-11, you’ll be able to stream music wirelessly from a Bluetooth capable mobile phone or a PC to the Network receiver. Thanks to the digital connection and aptX® audio coding algorithm, you’ll enjoy wireless music streaming with optimum sound quality. You can also conveniently power the YBA-11 via the DC-out connection on the rear panel of the amplifier.
		
			 
	
	
		
			
				
			
				 
		
	


	Speaker A, B or A+B Selection and Speaker Terminals for Two Systems

	 

	
		
			
				
			
				 
		
	
	
		
			You can connect two separate speaker systems in different rooms and switch between them, or have them both playing at the same time. There are four terminals, so by just pushing a button, you can switch speakers to match the sound source.
	


	Subwoofer Terminal

	
		
			A terminal for connecting a subwoofer is provided, allowing you to increase the bass output of your system for a more powerful sound with better overall sound quality.
	


	Phono MM Terminal

	
		
			You can connect a turntable with an MM phono cartridge to play vinyl records. This lets you enjoy not only CDs, but also analogue record sound from an amp with the latest digital/analogue technology.
	


	Simple yet Sophisticated Design

	 

	
		
			
				
			
				 
		
	
	
		
			With a beautifully simple and unique design inherited directly from Yamaha’s HiFi audio components, this amplifier also boast an easy-to-operate button layout. The aluminium front panel has a richly textured silver hairline finish. The control knobs are also of the same luxurious construction as used on our top-end models.
	


	Remote Control with Clean, Simple Design

	 

	
		
			
				
			
				 
		
	
	
		
			The clean, simple design of the remote control provides easy-to-understand one-hand operation. The easy-to-use design makes it simple to adjust song volume and order. The unit has a sophisticated looking hairline finish that matches the design of the amplifiers. You can also use the remote to control a Yamaha CD player.
	


	Rotary Encoder Input Selector with LEDs

	
		
			The rotary encoder makes it quick and easy to select input sources. The luxury hairline finish material offers a nice tactile feeling. LEDs clearly show which source is selected, so you can easily switch sources even in a dark room.
	


	Auto Power Standby Function

	 

	
		
			
		
			 
	


	The amplifier has a power management function that detects when it hasn't been used for a long time (about 8 hours) even though the power is on, and automatically shifts it into standby mode. So even if you forget to turn it off, power consumption will be minimised.

				AVENTAGE Features
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE Advantage - Overview
		
			
				
			
				Craftsmanship in engineering design. The AVENTAGE line of high-performance AV receivers is based on the audio design concept of providing a massive, full-bodied sound for movie sound effects and the accurate reproduction of music sources. By expertly harmonizing traditional and advanced technologies, every factor that affects sound quality, from materials and parts to construction, layout, vibration damping (unique foot) and “fine-tuning” the sound, is handled with no other thought than to achieve the best possible audio quality. As a result, every AVENTAGE model has the ability to reproduce the most subtle details of high-definition sound, so that listeners can enjoy a truly high-class sound studio experience at home.
		
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – Total Purity Concept
		
			
				
			
				Enjoy fine sound quality. The Total Purity Concept, which Yamaha has been cultivating for many years, encompasses high drive amp technology, high purity preamplification, anti-vibration technology and independent pure power supplies. All models have fully discrete power amplifiers that help minimize distortion. They also adopt pure independent power supplies, allowing dedicated power supplies for the analog and digital circuitry to prevent digital noise from affecting analog circuitry. The anti-vibration heat sinks are designed to suppress vibration from transistors and sound pressure. Independent power supplies for the DACs are designed to further eliminate noise on certain models. Down to every detail, these AV receivers are designed with full emphasis on the highest possible sound quality.
		
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – High Quality Parts
		
			The whole is greater than the sum. Every single part in an AV receiver affects the sound quality. For AVENTAGE models, extra time is taken to find (or develop) the exact parts needed to achieve the highest performance possible. Sound technicians go through a testing process to, in effect, ""tune"" the receiver's sound.
		
			
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – Anti-Resonance Technology
		
			
				
			
				A firm foundation. The Anti-Resonance Technology Wedge is a fifth foot in the center of the unit. It dampens vibrations from the power transformer, power transistors and heat sinks, as well as vibrations that might be caused by the sound from the speakers.
		
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – Advanced Foundational Design
		
			A foot fetish. The feet of the receiver feature a newly designed, high-density structure which utilizes two different kinds of interior ribs — straight and curved — to enhance strength and damping performance. Installation stability is improved and chassis resonance is dispersed, effectively eliminating external vibration. The low-range response is enhanced, while resonance peaks in the mid- and high-range are reduced, providing dynamic sound and accurate reproduction.
		
			
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – Aluminum Front Panel
		
			
				
			
				Shielded from noise. All of the AVENTAGE components feature the same sleek, clean design, with an elegant aluminum front panel and silky touch volume/selector knobs. The aluminum front panel is used to effectively shield sensitive circuitry from external noise and electronic radiation generated by dimmer switches, fluorescent lighting, video monitors and so on. This ensures optimum sonic performance in the widest range of installation environments.
		
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – Symmetrical Power Amplifier
		
			
				
			
				Designed to the details. The interior of the unit has been precisely planned, circuit-routed and built so that the left and right channels are physically and electrically isolated. This naturally maximizes channel separation but also greatly improves signal to noise ratio and also helps to achieve a wide open sound stage for a superior receiver.
		
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – H-shaped Frame
		
			
				
			
				Reinforced for rigidity. The interior of the receiver is reinforced with cross members in an H shape to provide an extremely rigid and stable frame. This reduces chassis vibration to virtually zero even during high volume output (seemingly minor vibrations can affect the sound), maintaining the highest audio quality.
		
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – ESS SABRE ES9007S Premier DACs
		
			
				
			
				More signal less noise. Incorporating dual SABRE ES9007S Premier Audio DACs from ESS Technology to achieve an exceptionally good signal-to-noise ratio and up to 120 dB of dynamic range, this AV receiver produces professional quality digital audio.
		
		
		
	


	
		
			AVENTAGE – Surround:AI
		
			
				
			
				Intelligent Surround. This AI technology built into the DSP analyzes the scene of your entertainment content and creates an optimal surround effect to reproduce it with the greatest effect. In real time, this AI instantaneously analyzes scenes by focusing on distinct sound elements such as dialogue, background music, ambient sounds and sound effects, and automatically optimizes the surround effect. The effect is a compelling sense of realism beyond conventional sound field effects, giving you the best of every scene in an entertainment experience.

			VCCS Vibration Control Cabinet Structure Technology
		
			
				
			
				To prevent unwanted cabinet vibration, Yamaha developed an internal structure called VCCS (Vibration Control Cabinet Structure) that uses strategically placed pieces of a composite material providing excellent vibration isolation performance. In addition, three legs provide additional shock absorption, considerably enhancing sound quality.
		
		
		
	


	
		
			2-Way System with High Quality White Cone Woofer
		
			
				
			
				The speaker units are a 12 cm (4-3/4"") cone woofer and a 3 cm (1-1/8"") soft dome tweeter. The woofer is an A-PMD (Advanced Polymer-injected Mica Diaphragm) unit created by downsizing and performing specialised tuning of a woofer used in Yamaha’s high-end speakers of “Soavo” line. It is a high specification speaker using the white cone, the symbol of Yamaha high sound quality.

			The NS-51 Series speakers enable you to enjoy a wide range of HD material including films and music with a full sense of the scale of the sound. The NS-F51 floor-standing speaker produces a wide range of rich sound, and together with the NS-P51 speaker package, which delivers clear dialogue and vocal sound, you can create a full-scale theatre optimal for large-screen TVs.
	


	Low-diffraction rounded form for clear sound free of murkiness.

	
		
			All NS-P51 speaker cabinets are rounded to reduce the diffraction effects that cause murky sound. Experience crystal-clear natural sound that you won’t tire of no matter how long you listen.
	


	A front grille and rounded form with luxurious, upscale design

	
		
			
				
		
	
	
		
			Enjoy a sense of luxury with a front grille featuring slanted corners and a design that brings to mind Yamaha’s flagship speakers. And with the speaker cabinet also sporting a rounded shape, the unity of design will fit beautifully into your home theatre space.
	


	Choice of two colours to help you create a high-quality home theatre.

	
		
			
				
		
	
	
		
			The speakers are beautifully finished and are available in a choice of two colours: the luxurious look of walnut, and stylish black. Together with the high-texture wood grain cabinet, these speakers will complement any TV monitor and interior.
